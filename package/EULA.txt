IMPORTANT - READ CAREFULLY: This Automatic Auditor Software Single User License Agreement
(&quot;Agreement&quot;) is a legal agreement between you (either an individual person or a single legal entity, who will be
referred to in this Agreement as &quot;You&quot;) and Soteria for the Automatic Auditor Software that accompanies this
Agreement, including any associated media, printed materials and electronic documentation (collectively
&quot;Software&quot;). The Software also includes any software updates, add-on components, web services and/or
supplements that Soteria may provide to you or make available to you after the date you obtain your initial copy of
the Software to the extent that such items are not accompanied by a separate license agreement or terms of use. By
installing, copying, downloading, accessing or otherwise using the Software, you agree to be bound by the terms of
this Agreement. If you do not agree to the terms of this Agreement, do not install, access or use the Software.

GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Soteria grants you ONE (1) non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, and non-transferable single user license during the
Term to use the Software solely for internal testing and evaluation purposes. This license entitles you to install the
Software on a single computer. You shall not use the Software for any purposes beyond the scope of the license
granted in this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing and except as otherwise expressly set forth in this
Agreement, you shall not at any time, directly or indirectly, (i) copy, modify, or create derivative works of the
Software, in whole or in part; (ii) rent, lease, lend, sell, sublicense, assign, distribute, publish, transfer, or otherwise
make available the Software; (iii) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, decode, adapt, or otherwise attempt to
derive or gain access to the source code of the Software, in whole or in part; (iv) remove any proprietary notices
from the Software; or (v) use the Software in any manner or for any purpose that infringes, misappropriates, or
otherwise violates any intellectual property right or other right of any person, or that violates any law, statute,
ordinance or other regulation (including export control and unfair competition laws) or any obligation to which you
are bound.

You are responsible and liable for all uses of the Software. You agree to comply with all applicable laws and
regulations regarding your use of the Software. You agree to indemnify, hold harmless, and, at Sotera’s option,
defend Soteria from and against any liability that Soteria may incur arising from your use of the Software.
You may use the Software solely to evaluate and test the Software pursuant to the terms of this Agreement during
the Term. Since the license is for evaluation purposes only, portions of the full use version of the Software may be
withheld or unusable and the use of the Software may require accessing portions of the Software remotely through
the Internet.

This Agreement does not entitle you to any such updates of the Software or any support service for the Software.

OWNERSHIP

All patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other proprietary rights in or related to the Software are and shall remain
the exclusive property of Soteria whether or not specifically recognized or perfected under the laws of the country
where the Software is located. Except for the limited rights and the license expressly granted under this Agreement,
nothing in this Agreement grants, by implication, waiver, estoppel, or otherwise, to you any intellectual property
rights or other right, title, or interest in or to the Software. If you send or transmit any communications or materials
to Soteria by mail, email, telephone, or otherwise, suggesting or recommending changes to the Software, including
without limitation, new features or functionality relating thereto, or any comments, questions, suggestions, or the
like (&quot;Feedback&quot;), Soteria is free to use such Feedback irrespective of any other obligation or limitation between the
parties governing such Feedback. You hereby assign and agree to assign any and all rights you may have or acquire
in or to the Software and the Feedback to Soteria for no additional consideration.

You will not take any action that jeopardizes Soteria&#39;s or its licensors&#39; proprietary rights or acquire any rights in the
Software. Soteria or its designee will own all rights in any copy, translation, modification, adaptation or derivation
of the Software, including any improvement or development thereof. At Soteria&#39;s request, you will execute or obtain
the execution of any instrument that may be appropriate to assign these rights to Soteria or its designee or to perfect
these rights in Soteria&#39;s or its designee&#39;s name.

CONFIDENTIALITY

(a) Confidentiality. You acknowledge that the Software is and incorporates confidential and proprietary information
developed, acquired by or licensed to Soteria. You will take all reasonable precautions necessary to safeguard the
confidentiality of the Software, and will not disclose any information about the Software or the Software evaluations
or reports to any other person without Soteria’s prior written permission. You will not allow the removal or
defacement of any confidentiality or proprietary notice placed on the Software. The placement of a copyright notice
on the Software will not constitute publication or otherwise impair its confidential nature.
(b) Unauthorized Use or Disclosure. You acknowledge that any unauthorized use or disclosure of the Software will
cause irreparable harm to Soteria and its licensors. If an unauthorized use or disclosure occurs, you will take all steps
that are necessary to recover the Software and to prevent its subsequent unauthorized use or dissemination.
(c) Limitation. You will have no confidentiality obligation with respect to any portion of the Software that (i) you
lawfully obtained from a third party under no obligation of confidentiality or (ii) became available to the public
other than as a result of your act or omission.

DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND ALL EXPRESS, IMPLIED, AND STATUTORY
CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT,
AND ALL WARRANTIES ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE, OR TRADE PRACTICE ARE
DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO BE LEGALLY
INVALID. SOTERIA MAKES NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND THAT THE SOFTWARE, OR ANY
PRODUCTS OR RESULTS OF THE USE THEREOF, WILL MEET YOUR OR ANY OTHER PERSON&#39;S
REQUIREMENTS, OPERATE WITHOUT INTERRUPTION, ACHIEVE ANY INTENDED RESULT, BE

ACCURATE, COMPLETE, FREE OF HARMFUL CODE, OR ERROR FREE.

DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES

TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SOTERIA OR ITS LICENSORS BE
LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS IN REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED REGARDLESS OF THE
THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE
SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SOTERIA HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO
EVENT WILL SOTERIA&#39;S LIABILITY TO YOU, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU FOR SOFTWARE UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY AGREED OR OTHER
REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

TERM AND TERMINATION

The term of this Agreement begins on the delivery of the Software and, unless terminated earlier as set forth in this
Agreement, will continue in effect until one hundred eighty (180) days from such date (the &quot;Term&quot;). You may
terminate this Agreement at any time by destroying all copies of the Software. This Agreement will terminate
immediately without notice from Soteria if you fail to comply with any provision of this Agreement. Upon

Termination, the license granted hereunder will also terminate, and without limiting your obligations under the
“Confidentiality” clause set forth above, you shall (i) promptly de-install and delete all copies of the Software in
your possession, (ii) discontinue any further use of the Software, and (iii) certify in writing to Soteria that the
Software has been deleted or destroyed. The parties&#39; rights and obligations will survive the termination of this
Agreement.

MISCELLANEOUS

You and Soteria are independent parties. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as making you an employee,
agent or legal representative of Soteria.

This Agreement constitutes the complete and entire statement of all terms, conditions and representations of the
agreement between you and Soteria with respect to the Software.
If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, this Agreement will remain in effect with the
provision omitted, unless omission would frustrate the intent of the parties, in which case this Agreement will
immediately terminate.

You shall comply with any and all antiboycott laws including any executive orders, rules, and regulations. The
Software may be subject to US export control laws, including the Export Control Reform Act and its associated
regulations. You shall not, and shall not permit any third parties to, directly or indirectly, export, re-export, or
release the Software to, or make the Software accessible from, any jurisdiction or country to which export, re-export,
or release is prohibited by law, rule, or regulation. You warrant and represent that you are not the target of any laws
administered by the United States Department of the Treasury&#39;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (&quot;OFAC&quot;) or any
other governmental entity (including but not limited to the United State Department of State) imposing economic
sanctions or trade embargoes (&quot;Economic Sanctions Laws&quot;), or are located, organized, or resident in a country or
territory that is, or whose government is, the target of sanctions imposed by OFAC or any other governmental entity.
The Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the substantive law of the State of Texas,
excluding its conflicts of law provisions, and by the courts of that state.

This Agreement is the entire agreement between you and Soteria relating to its subject matter. It supersedes all prior
or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, representations and warranties and prevails over any
conflicting or additional terms of any quote, order, acknowledgment, or other communication between the parties
relating to its subject matter during the term of this Agreement. No modification of this Agreement will be binding,
unless in writing and signed by an authorized representative of each party.
