Changes in 0.9.4 (Aug 30, 2005)
- Fixed major bug that prevented pbzip2 from uncompressing files
  created with a BWT block size other than default 900k (oops!)
- Fixed some bugs in the command line parser
- Code cleanup
- Updated RPM spec to match Fedora Extras policy

Changes in 0.9.3 (Aug 22, 2005)
- Added sanity check to ensure integers are the size we expect
- Ported code to compile under MinGW in Windows
- Small code cleanup
- Added ChangeLog
- Added man page
- Added AUTHORS file
- Renamed LICENCE.txt to COPYING
- Renamed README.txt to README
- Updated RPM spec file in preparation for inclusion into Fedora Extras
- Moved ChangeLog info from pbzip2.cpp into this file
- Removed extra spaces/tabs in pbzip2.cpp

Changes in 0.9.2 (Mar 12, 2005)
- Created workaround for a major pthreads problem (on Linux at least)
  that would cause segfaults and missed signals in the pthreads
- Increased size of BZIP2 header match from 56 bits to 72 bits for more
  accurate detection
- Modified some buffers to use the vector class for easier memory
  management and to eliminate one read pass of the input data for
  decompression so should be slightly faster
- Now checks if input file exists before checking if output file
  already exists (when not using -f)
- Now checks to ensure input is regular file and not a directory before
  processing
- Now deletes input file only if output file exists and is greater than
  0 bytes (-k will always preserve input file)
- Now checks input file for bzip2 header before trying to decompress
  file
- Minor code cleanup

Changes in 0.9.1 (Jan 29, 2005)
- Fixed bug: -c switch now implies -k so input file is not deleted when
  data is output to stdout

Changes in 0.9 (Jan 24, 2005)
- Added -c switch for data output to stdout
- Added -t switch to test integrity of compressed data
- Added autodetection for # of CPUs on supported platforms and made
  detected value default # CPUs to use
- Fixed bug where pbzip2 processed 0 byte files
- Tried to make program exit codes the same as bzip2

Changes in 0.8.3 (Jan 9, 2005)
- Added support to maintain file metadata
- Added signal handling to cleanup partial files
- Added support to process multiple files

Changes in 0.8.2 (Nov 30, 2004)
- Added support for large (2GB+) files
- Added version info
- Made command line input more like bzip2
- Now checks if file is already .bz2 first

Changes in 0.8.1 (Nov 27, 2004)
- Fix pthread bug, now works on OSF1, code cleanup

Changes in 0.8 (Sep 6, 2004)
