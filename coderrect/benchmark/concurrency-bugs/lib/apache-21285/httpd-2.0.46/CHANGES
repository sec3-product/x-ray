Changes with Apache 2.0.46

  *) SECURITY [CAN-2003-0245]: Fixed a bug that could be triggered
     remotely through mod_dav and possibly other mechanisms, causing
     an Apache child process to crash.  The crash was first reported
     by David Endler <DEndler@iDefense.com> and was researched and
     fixed by Joe Orton <jorton@redhat.com>.  Details will be released
     on 30 May 2003.

  *) SECURITY [CAN-2003-0189]: Fixed a denial-of-service vulnerability
     affecting basic authentication on Unix platforms related to
     thread-safety in apr_password_validate().  The problem was reported
     by John Hughes <john.hughes@entegrity.com>.

  *) Fix for mod_dav.  Call the 'can_be_activity' callback, if provided,
     when a MKACTIVITY request comes in.
     [Ben Collins-Sussman <sussman@collab.net>]

  *) Perform run-time query in apxs for apr and apr-util's includes.
     [Justin Erenkrantz] 

  *) run libtool from the apr install directory (in case that is different
     from the apache install directory) [Jeff Trawick]

  *) configure.in: Play nice with libtool-1.5. [Wilfredo Sanchez]

  *) If mod_mime_magic does not know the content-type, do not attempt to
     guess.  PR 16908.  [Andrew Gapon <agapon@telcordia.com>]

  *) ssl session caching(shmht) : Fix a SEGV problem with SHMHT session
     caching. PR 17864.
     [Andreas Leimbacher <andreasl67@yahoo.de>, Madhusudan Mathihalli]

  *) Add a delete flag to htpasswd.
     [Thom May]

  *) Fix mod_rewrite's handling of absolute URIs. The escaping routines
     now work scheme dependent and the query string will only be
     appended if supported by the particular scheme.  [André Malo]

  *) Add another check for already compressed content in mod_deflate.
     PR 19913. [Tsuyoshi SASAMOTO <nazonazo@super.win.ne.jp>]

  *) Fixes for VPATH builds; copying special.mk and any future .mk files 
     from the source tree as well as the build tree (now creates a usable
     configuration for apxs), and eliminated redundant -I'nclude paths.
     [William Rowe]

  *) Code fixes, constness corrections and ssl_toolkit_compat.h updates
     for SSLC and OpenSSL toolkit compatibility.  Still work remains to
     be done to cripple features based on the limitations of RSA's binary 
     distribution of their SSL-C toolkit.
     [William Rowe, Madhusudan Mathihalli, Jeff Trawick]

  *) Linux 2.4+: If Apache is started as root and you code 
     CoreDumpDirectory, coredumps are enabled via the prctl() syscall.
     [Greg Ames]

  *) ap_get_mime_headers_core: allocate space for the trailing null
     when folding is in effect.
     PR 18170 [Peter Mayne <PeterMayne@SPAM_SUX.ap.spherion.com>]

  *) Fix --enable-mods-shared=most and other variants.  [Aaron Bannert]

  *) mod_log_config: Add the ability to log the id of the thread 
     processing the request via new %P formats.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Use appropriate language codes for Czech (cs) and Traditional Chinese
     (zh-tw) in default config files. PR 9427.  [André Malo]

  *) mod_auth_ldap: Use generic whitespace character class when parsing
     "require" directives, instead of literal spaces only. PR 17135.
     [André Malo]

  *) Hook mod_rewrite's type checker before mod_mime's one. That way the
     RewriteRule [T=...] Flag should work as expected now. PR 19626.
     [André Malo]

  *) htpasswd: Check the processed file on validity. If a line is not empty
     and not a comment, it must contain at least one colon. Otherwise exit
     with error code 7. [Kris Verbeeck <Kris.Verbeeck@ubizen.com>, Thom May]

  *) Fix a problem that caused httpd to be linked with incorrect flags
     on some platforms when mod_so was enabled by default, breaking 
     DSOs on AIX.  PR 19012  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) By default, use the same CC and CPP with which APR was built.
     The user can override with CC and CPP environment variables.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix ap_construct_url() so that it surrounds IPv6 literal address
     strings with [].  This fixes certain types of redirection.
     PR 19207.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) forward port of buffer overflow fixes for htdigest. [Thom May]

  *) Added AllowEncodedSlashes directive to permit control of whether
     the server will accept encoded slashes ('%2f') in the URI path.
     Default condition is off (the historical behaviour).  This permits
     environments in which the path-info needs to contain encoded
     slashes.  PR 543, 2389, 3581, 3589, 5687, 7066, 7865, 14639.  [Ken Coar]

  *) When using Redirect in directory context, append requested query
     string if there's no one supplied by configuration. PR 10961.
     [André Malo]

  *) Unescape the supplied wildcard pattern in mod_autoindex. Otherwise
     the pattern will not always match as desired. PR 12596.
     [André Malo]

  *) mod_autoindex now emits and accepts modern query string parameter
     delimiters (;). Thus column headers no longer contain unescaped
     ampersands. PR 10880  [André Malo]

  *) Enable ap_sock_disable_nagle for Windows. This along with the 
     addition of APR_TCP_NODELAY_INHERITED to apr.hw will cause Nagle 
     to be disabled for Windows. [Allan Edwards]

  *) Correct a mis-correlation between mpm_common.c and mpm_common.h;
     This patch reverts us to pre-2.0.46 behavior, using the 
     ap_sock_disable_nagle noop macro, because ap_sock_disable_nagle 
     was never compiled on Win32. [Allan Edwards, William Rowe]

  *) Fix a build problem with passing unsupported --enable-layout
     args to apr and apr-util.  This broke binbuild.sh as well as
     user-specified layout parameters.  PR 18649 [Justin Erenkrantz,
     Jeff Trawick]

  *) If a Date response header was already set in the headers array,
     this value was ignored in favour of the current time. This meant
     that Date headers on proxied requests where rewritten when they
     should not have been. PR: 14376 [Graham Leggett]

  *) Add code to buildconf that produces an httpd.spec file from
     httpd.spec.in, using build/get-version.sh from APR.
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) Fixed a segfault when multiple ProxyBlock directives were used.
     PR: 19023 [Sami Tikka <sami.tikka@f-secure.com>]

  *) SECURITY [CAN-2003-0134] OS2: Fix a Denial of Service vulnerability 
     identified and reported by Robert Howard <rihoward@rawbw.com> that 
     where device names faulted the running OS2 worker process.
     The fix is actually in APR 0.9.4.  [Brian Havard]

  *) Forward port: Escape special characters (especially control
     characters) in mod_log_config to make a clear distinction between
     client-supplied strings (with special characters) and server-side
     strings. This was already introduced in version 1.3.25.
     [André Malo]

  *) mod_deflate: Check also err_headers_out for an already set
     Content-Encoding: gzip header. This prevents gzip compressed content
     from a CGI script from being compressed once more. PR 17797.
     [André Malo]

Changes with Apache 2.0.45

  *) Fix possible segfaults under obscure error conditions within the
     cgid daemon.  [Jeff Trawick, William Rowe]

  *) SECURITY [CAN-2003-0132]: Close a Denial of Service vulnerability
     identified by David Endler <DEndler@iDefense.com> on all platforms.
     An unlimited stream of newlines were acceptable between requests
     where each <lf> would allocate an 80 byte buffer, leading very
     quickly to memory exahustion.  [Brian Pane]

  *) Added an rpm build script.
     [Graham Leggett, Joe Orton <jorton@redhat.com>]

  *) Simpler, faster code path for request header scanning  [Brian Pane]

  *) SECURITY:  Eliminated leaks of several file descriptors to child
     processes, such as CGI scripts.  This fix depends on the APR library 
     release 0.9.2 or later (0.9.3 was distributed with the httpd 
     source tarball for Apache 2.0.45.)  PR 17206
     [Christian Kratzer <ck@cksoft.de>, Bjoern A. Zeeb <bz@zabbadoz.net>]

  *) Fix path handling of mod_rewrite, especially on non-unix systems.
     There was some confusion between local paths and URL paths.
     PR 12902.  [André Malo]

  *) Prevent endless loops of internal redirects in mod_rewrite by
     aborting after exceeding a limit of internal redirects. The
     limit defaults to 10 and can be changed using the RewriteOptions
     directive. PR 17462.  [André Malo]

  *) Win32: Avoid busy wait (consuming all the CPU idle cycles) when
     all worker threads are busy. 
     [Igor Nazarenko <igor_nazarenko@hotmail.com>]

  *) Keep the subrequest filter in place when a subrequest is 
     redirected.  PR 15423.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) you can now specify the compression level for mod_deflate. 
     [Ian Holsman, Stephen Pierzchala <stephen@pierzchala.com>, 
     Michael Schroepl <Michael.Schroepl@telekurs.de>]

  *) mod_deflate: Extend the DeflateFilterNote directive to
     allow accurate logging of the filter's in- and outstream.
     [André Malo]

  *) Allow SSLMutex to select/use the full range of APR locking
     mechanisms available to it. Also, fix the bug that SSLMutex uses
     APR_LOCK_DEFAULT no matter what.  PR 8122  [Jim Jagielski,
     martin.t.kutschker@blackbox.net (Martin Kutschker)]

  *) Restore the ability of htdigest.exe to create files that contain
     more than one user. PR 12910.  [André Malo]

  *) Improve binary compatibility of the core between debug (aka
     maintainer-mode) and a non-debug compile.
     [Sander Striker]

  *) mod_usertrack: don't set the cookie in subrequests. This works
     around the problem that cookies were set twice during fast internal
     redirects. PR 13211.  [André Malo]

  *) mod_autoindex no longer forgets output format and enabled version
     sort in linked column headers.  [André Malo]

  *) Use .sv instead of .se as extension for Swedish documents in the
     default configuration. PR 12877.  [André Malo]

  *) Updated mod_ldap and mod_auth_ldap to support the Novell LDAP SDK SSL
     and standardized the LDAP SSL support across the various LDAP SDKs.  
     Isolated the SSL functionality to mod_ldap rather than speading it 
     across mod_auth_ldap and mod_ldap.  Also added LDAPTrustedCA
     and LDAPTrustedCAType directives to mod_ldap to allow for a more 
     common method of specifying the SSL certificate.
     [Dave Ward, Brad Nicholes]

  *) Fixed mod_ssl's SSLCertificateChain initialization to no longer 
     skip the first cert of the chain by default.  This misbehavior 
     was introduced in 2.0.34.  PR 14560  [Madhusudan Mathihalli]

  *) mod_cgi, mod_cgid, mod_ext_filter: Log errors when scripts cannot
     be started on Unix because of such problems as bad permissions,
     bad shebang line, etc.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix 64-bit problem in mod_ssl input logic.  
     [Madhusudan Mathihalli <madhusudan_mathihalli@hp.com>]

  *) Fix potential memory leaks in mod_deflate on malformed data.  PR 16046.
     [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Rewrite ap_xml_parse_input to use bucket brigades.  PR 16134.
     [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Fix segfault which occurred when a section in an included
     configuration file was not closed. PR 17093.  [André Malo]

  *) Enhance the behavior of mod_isapi's WriteClient() callback to
     provide better emulation for isapi modules that presume that the
     first WriteClient() call may send status and headers.  An example
     of WriteClient() abuse is the foxisapi module, which relies on
     that assumpion and now works.  [William Rowe, Milan Kosina]

  *) Check the return value of ap_run_pre_connection(). So if the
     pre_connection phase fails (without setting c->aborted)
     ap_run_process_connection is not executed. [Stas Bekman]

  *) Fixed a problem with mod_ldap which caused it to fault when caching
     was disabled.  Needed to make sure that the code did not
     attempt to use the cache if it didn't exist. Also fixed some memory
     leaks which were due to not releasing LDAP resources on error
     conditions.  [Brad Nicholes]
     
  *) Hook mod_proxy's fixup before mod_rewrite's fixup, so that by
     mod_rewrite proxied URLs will not be escaped accidentally by
     mod_proxy's fixup. PR 16368  [André Malo]

  *) While processing filters on internal redirects, remember seen EOS
     buckets also in the request structure of the redirect issuer(s). This
     prevents filters (such as mod_deflate) from adding garbage to the
     response. PR 14451.  [André Malo]

  *) suexec: Be more pedantic when cleaning environment. Clean it
     immediately after startup. PR 2790, 10449.
     [Jeff Stewart <jws@purdue.edu>, André Malo]

  *) Fix apxs to insert LoadModule directives only outside of sections.
     PR 8712, 9012.  [André Malo]

  *) Fix suexec compile error under SUNOS4, where strerror() doesn't
     exist. PR 5913, 9977.
     [Jonathan W Miner <Jonathan.W.Miner@lmco.com>]

  *) Fix If header parsing when a non-mod_dav lock token is passed to it.
     PR 16452.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) mod_auth_digest no longer tries to guess AuthDigestDomain, if it's
     not specified. Now it assumes "/" as already documented. PR 16937.
     [André Malo]

  *) Try to log an error if a piped log program fails.  Try to
     restart a piped log program in more failure situations.  Fix an
     existing problem with error handling in piped_log_spawn().  Use
     new APR apr_proc_create() features to prevent Apache from starting
     on Unix* in most cases where a piped log program can be started,
     and add log messages for the other situations.  *Other platforms
     already failed Apache initialization if a piped log program
     couldn't be started.  PR 15761  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix mod_cern_meta to not create empty metafiles when the
     metafile searched for does not exist.  PR 12353
     [Owen Rees <owen_rees@hp.com>]

  *) Introduce debugging symbols for Win32 release builds, both .pdb 
     and .dbg files (older debuggers and Dr. Watson-type utilities 
     on WinNT or Win9x don't support the newer .pdb flavor.)
     [Allen Edwards, William Rowe]
 
  *) Fix bug where 'Satisfy Any' without an AuthType lost all MIME
     information (and more). Related to PR 9076.  [André Malo]

  *) mod_file_cache: fix segfault serving mmaped cached files.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) mod_file_cache: fixed a segfault when multiple MMapFile directives
     were used.  PR 16313.  [Cliff Woolley]

  *) Fix a nasty segfault in mmap_bucket_setaside() caused by passing
     an incompatible pointer type to mmap_bucket_destroy(void*).
     [Gerard Eviston <geviston@bigpond.net.au>]

  *) Enable the -n name parameter on NetWare to allow the
     administrator to rename the Apache console screen
     [Brad Nicholes]
     
  *) Fixed piped access logs on Win32 by disabling OTHER_CHILD
     support by default in APR.  More development is required
     to deploy OTHER_CHILD on Win32.  [William Rowe]

  *) Use saner default config values for suexec. PR 15713.
     [Thom May <thom@planetarytramp.net>]

  *) mod_rewrite: Allow "RewriteEngine Off" even if no "Options FollowSymlinks"
     (or SymlinksIfOwnermatch) is set. PR 12395.  [André Malo]

  *) apxs: Include any special APR ld flags when linking the DSO.
     This resolves problems on AIX when building a DSO with apxs+gcc.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Added character set support to mod_auth_LDAP to allow it to 
     convert extended characters used in the user ID to UTF-8 
     before authenticating against the LDAP directory. The new
     directive AuthLDAPCharsetConfig is used to specify the config
     file that contains the character set conversion table.
     [Brad Nicholes]

  *) Don't remove the Content-Length from responses in mod_proxy
     PR: 8677 [Brian Pane]

  *) Ensure LDAP version is set to v3 on every bind. PR 14235.
     [Sergey A. Lipnevich <sergeyli@pisem.net>]

  *) Fix mod_ldap to open an existing shared memory file should one
     already exist. PR 12757. [Scooter Morris <scooter@gene.com>,
     Graham Leggett]

  *) Fix the ulimit command used by apachectl on Tru64.  PR 13609.
     [Joseph Senulis <Joseph.Senulis@dnr.state.wi.us>, Jeff Trawick]

  *) Change the ulimit command used by apachectl on AIX so that it
     works in all locales.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) mod_ext_filter: Fix a problem building argument lists which 
     occasionally caused exec to fail.  PR 15491.  [Jeff Trawick]

Changes with Apache 2.0.44

  *) mod_autoindex: Bring forward the IndexOptions IgnoreCase option
     from Apache 1.3.  PR 14276
     [David Shane Holden <dpejesh@yahoo.com>, William Rowe]

  *) mod_mime: Workaround to prevent a segfault if r->filename=NULL
     [Brian Pane]
 
  *) Reorder the definitions for mod_ldap and mod_auth_ldap within
     config.m4 to make sure the parent mod_ldap is defined first.
     This ensures that mod_ldap comes before mod_auth_ldap in the
     httpd.conf file, which is necessary for mod_auth_ldap to load.
     PR 14256  [Graham Leggett]

  *) Fix the building of cgi command lines when the query string
     contains '='.  PR 13914  [Ville Skyttä <ville.skytta@iki.fi>,
     Jeff Trawick]

  *) Rename CacheMaxStreamingBuffer to MCacheMaxStreamingBuffer. Move
     implementation of MCacheMaxStreamingBuffer from mod_cache to
     mod_mem_cache. MCacheMaxStreamingBuffer now defaults to the
     lesser of 100,000 bytes or MCacheMaxCacheObjectSize. This should 
     eliminate the need for explicitly coding MCacheMaxStreamingBuffer
     in most configurations. [Bill Stoddard]

  *) mod_cache: Fix PR 15113, a core dump in cache_in_filter when
     a redirect occurs. The code was passing a format string and
     integer to apr_pstrcat. Changed to apr_psprintf.
     [Paul J. Reder]

  *) Replace APU_HAS_LDAPSSL_CLIENT_INIT with APU_HAS_LDAP_NETSCAPE_SSL
     as set by apr-util in util_ldap.c. This should allow mod_ldap
     to work with the Netscape/Mozilla LDAP library. [Øyvin Sømme
     <somme@oslo.westerngeco.slb.com>, Graham Leggett]

  *) Fix critical bug in new --enable-v4-mapped configure option
     implementation which broke IPv4 listening sockets on some
     systems.  [hiroyuki hanai <hanai@imgsrc.co.jp>]

  *) mod_setenvif: Fix BrowserMatchNoCase support for non-regex
     patterns [André Malo <nd@perlig.de>]

  *) Add version string to provider API.  [Justin Erenkrantz]
 
  *) build: './configure && make' now works without an in-tree
     apr and apr-util. [Wilfredo Sanchez]

  *) mod_negotiation: Set the appropriate mime response headers
     (Content-Type, charset, Content-Language and Content-Encoding)
     for negotated type-map "Body:" responses (such as the error
     pages.)  [André Malo <nd@perlig.de>]

  *) mod_log_config: Allow '%%' escaping in CustomLog format
     strings to insert a literal, single '%'.
     [André Malo <nd@perlig.de>]

  *) mod_autoindex: AddDescription directives for directories
     now work as in Apache 1.3, where no trailing '/' is
     specified on the directory name.  Previously, the trailing
     '/' *had* to be specified, which was incompatible with
     Apache 1.3.  PR 7990  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix for PR 14556. The expiry calculations in mod_cache were
     trying to perform "now + ((date - lastmod) * factor)" where
     date == lastmod resulting in "now + 0". The code now follows
     the else path (using the default expiration) if date is
     equal to lastmod. [rx@armstrike.com (Sergey), Paul J. Reder]

  *) Use AP_DECLARE in the debug versions of ap_strXXX in case the
     default calling convention is not the same as the one used by
     AP_DECLARE.  [Juan Rivera <Juan.Rivera@citrix.com>]

  *) mod_cache: Don't cache response header fields designated
     as hop-by-hop headers in HTTP/1.1 (RFC 2616 Section 13.5.1).
     [Estrade Matthieu <estrade-m@ifrance.com>, Brian Pane]

  *) mod_cgid: Handle environment variables containing newlines.
     PR 14550  [Piotr Czejkowski <apache@czarny.eu.org>, Jeff
     Trawick]

  *) Move mod_ext_filter out of experimental and into filters.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fixed a memory leak in mod_deflate with dynamic content.
     PR 14321  [Ken Franken <kfranken@decisionmark.com>]

  *) Add --[enable|disable]-v4-mapped configure option to control
     whether or not Apache expects to handle IPv4 connections
     on IPv6 listening sockets.  Either setting will work on 
     systems with the IPV6_V6ONLY socket option.  --enable-v4-mapped
     must be used on systems that always allow IPv4 connections on
     IPv6 listening sockets.  PR 14037 (Bugzilla), PR 7492 (Gnats)
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) This fixes a problem where the underlying cache code
     indicated that there was one more element on the cache
     than there actually was. This happened since element 0
     exists but is not used. This code allocates the correct
     number of useable elements and reports the number of
     actually used elements. The previous code only allowed
     MCacheMaxObjectCount-1 objects to be stored in the
     cache. [Paul J. Reder]

  *) mod_setenvif: Add SERVER_ADDR special keyword to allow
     envariable setting according to the server IP address
     which received the request.  [Ken Coar]

  *) mod_cgid: Terminate CGI scripts when the client connection 
     drops.  PR 8388  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Rearrange OpenSSL engine initialization to support RAND 
     redirection on crypto accelerator. 
     [Frederic DONNAT <frederic.donnat@zencod.com>]

  *) Always emit Vary header if mod_deflate is involved in the
     request.  [Andre Malo <nd@perlig.de>]

  *) mod_isapi: Stop unsetting the 'empty' query string result with
     a NULL argument in ecb->lpszQueryString, eliminating segfaults
     for some ISAPI modules.  PR 14399
     [Detlev Vendt <detlev.vendt@brillit.de>]

  *) mod_isapi: Fix an issue where the HSE_REQ_DONE_WITH_SESSION
     notification is received before the HttpExtensionProc() returns 
     HSE_STATUS_PENDING.  This only affected isapi .dll's configured 
     with the ISAPIFakeAsync on directive.  PR 11918
     [John DeSetto <jdesetto@radiantsystems.com>, William Rowe]

  *) mod_isapi: Fix the issue where all results from mod_isapi would
     run through the core die handler resulting in invalid responses
     or access log entries.  PR 10216 [William Rowe]

  *) Improves the user friendliness of the CacheRoot processing
     over my last pass. This version avoids the pool allocations
     but doesn't avoid all of the runtime checks. It no longer
     terminates during post-config processing. An error is logged
     once per worker, indicating that the CacheRoot needs to be set.
     [Paul J. Reder]

  *) Fix a bug where we keep files open until the end of a 
     keepalive connection, which can result in:
     (24)Too many open files: file permissions deny server access
     especially on threaded servers.  [Greg Ames, Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix a bug in which mod_proxy sent an invalid Content-Length
     when a proxied URL was invoked as a server-side include within
     a page generated in response to a form POST.  [Brian Pane]

  *) Added code to process min and max file size directives and to
     init the expirychk flag in mod_disk_cache. Added a clarifying
     comment to cache_util.   [Paul J. Reder]

  *) The value emitted by ServerSignature now mimics the Server HTTP
     header as controlled by ServerTokens.  [Francis Daly <deva@daoine.org>]

  *) Gracefully handly retry situations in the SSL input filter,
     by following the SSL libraries' retry semantics.
     [William Rowe]

  *) Terminate CGI scripts when the client connection drops.  This
     fix only applies to some normal paths in mod_cgi.  mod_cgid
     is still busted.  PR 8388  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix a bug where 416 "Range not satisfiable" was being
     returned for content that should have been redirected.
     [Greg Ames]

  *) Fix memory leak in mod_ssl from internal SSL library allocations
     within SSL_get_peer_certificate and X509_get_pubkey.
     [Zvi Har'El <rl@math.technion.ac.il>
      Madhusudan Mathihalli <madhusudan_mathihalli@hp.com>].

  *) mod_ssl uses free() inappropriately in several places, to free
     memory which has been previously allocated inside OpenSSL.
     Such memory should be freed with OPENSSL_free(), not with free().

  *) Emit a message to the error log when we return 404 because
     the URI contained '%2f'.  (This was previously nastily silent
     and difficult to debug.)  [Ken Coar]

  *) Fix streaming output from an nph- CGI script.  CGI:IRC now
     works.  PR 8482  [Jeff Trawick]

     the client terminates the connection before the response
     is completely sent  [Bojan Smojver <bojan@rexursive.com>]

  *) Fix some problems in the perchild MPM.  
     [Jonas Eriksson <jonas@webkonsulterna.com>]

  *) Change the CacheRoot processing to check for a required
     value at config time. This saves a lot of wasted processing
     if the mod_disk_cache module is loaded but no CacheRoot
     was provided. This fix also adds code to log an error
     and avoid useless pallocs and procesing when the computed
     cache file name cannot be opened. This also updates the
     docs accordingly.  [Paul J. Reder]

  *) Introduce the EnableSendfile directive, allowing users of NFS 
     shares to disable sendfile mechanics when they either fail
     outright or provide intermitantly corrupted data.  PR

  *) Resolve the error "An operation was attempted on something 
     that is not a socket.  : winnt_accept: AcceptEx failed. 
     Attempting to recover." for users of various firewall and
     anti-virus software on Windows.  PR 8325  [William Rowe]

  *) Add the ProxyBadHeader directive, which gives the admin some
     control on how mod_proxy should handle bogus HTTP headers from
     proxied servers. This allows 2.0 to "emulate" 1.3's behavior if
     desired. [Jim Jagielski]

  *) Change the LDAP modules to export their symbols correctly
     during a Windows build. Add dsp files for Windows. Update
     README.ldap file for Windows build instructions.

Changes with Apache 2.0.43

  *) SECURITY: [CAN-2002-0840] HTML-escape the address produced by 
     ap_server_signature() against this cross-site scripting 
     vulnerability exposed by the directive 'UseCanonicalName Off'.  
     Also HTML-escape the SERVER_NAME environment variable for CGI 
     and SSI requests.  It's safe to escape as only the '<', '>', 
     and '&' characters are affected, which won't appear in a valid 
     hostname.  Reported by Matthew Murphy <mattmurphy@kc.rr.com>.
     [Brian Pane]

  *) Fix a core dump in mod_cache when it attemtped to store uncopyable
     buckets. This happened, for instance, when a file to be cached
     contained SSI tags to execute a CGI script (passed as a pipe
     bucket). [Paul J. Reder]

  *) Ensure that output already available is flushed to the network
     when the content-length filter realizes that no new output will
     be available for a while.  This helps some streaming CGIs as
     well as some other dynamically-generated content.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix a mutex problem in mod_ssl session cache support which
     could lead to an infinite loop.  PR 12705

  *) Get mod_auth_ldap to retry connections on LDAP_SERVER_DOWN.
     [Thomas Bennett <thomas.bennett@eds.com>, Graham Leggett]

  *) Make sure the contents of the WWW-Authenticate header is
     passed on a 4xx error by proxy. Previously all headers
     were dropped, resulting in the browser being unable to
     authenticate. [Dr Richard Reiner <rreiner@fscinternet.com>,

     <dhenderson@fscinternet.com>]

  *) Make mod_cache's CacheMaxStreamingBuffer directive work
     properly for virtual hosts that override server-wide mod_cache
     setttings.  [Matthieu Estrade <estrade-m@ifrance.com>]

  *) Add support for using fnmatch patterns in the final path
     segment of an Include statement (eg.. include /foo/bar/*.conf).
     and remove the noise on stderr during config dir processing.
     [Joe Orton <jorton@redhat.com>]

  *) mod_cache: cache_storage.c. Add the hostname and any request
     args to the key generated for caching. This provides a unique
     key for each virtual host and for each request with unique
     args. [Paul J. Reder, args code provided by Kris Verbeeck]

  *) mod_cache: Do not cache responses to GET requests with query
     URLs if the origin server does not explicitly provide an
     Expires header on the response (RFC 2616 Section 13.9)

  *) Fix some bucket memory leaks in the chunking code
     [Joe Schaefer <joe+apache@sunstarsys.com>]

  *) Add ModMimeUsePathInfo directive.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) mod_cache: added support for caching streamed responses (proxy,
     CGI, etc) with optional CacheMaxStreamingBuffer setting [Brian Pane]

  *) Add image/x-icon to httpd.conf PR 10993.
     [Ian Holsman, Peter Bieringer <pb@bieringer.de>]

  *) Fix FileETags none operation.  PR 12207.
     [Justin Erenkrantz, Andrew Ho <andrew@tellme.com>]

  *) Restored the experimental leader/followers MPM to working

  *) Fix "ab -g"'s truncated year: the last digit was cut off.
     [Leon Brocard <acme@astray.com>]

  *) mod_rewrite can now sets cookies in err_headers, uses the correct
     expiry date, and can now set the path as well
     PR 12132,12181,12172.
     [Ian Holsman / Rob Cromwell <apachechangelog@robcromwell.com>]

  *) The content-length filter no longer tries to buffer up
     the entire output of a long-running request before sending
     anything to the client.  [Brian Pane]

  *) Win32: Lower the default stack size from 1MB to 256K. This will
     allow around 8000 threads to be started per child process. 
     'EDITBIN /STACK:size apache.exe' can be used to change this 
     value directly in the apache.exe executable.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Win32: Implement ThreadLimit directive in the Windows MPM.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Remove CacheOn config directive since it is set but never checked.
     No sense wasting cycles on unused code. Besides, the only truly
     bug free code is deleted code. :)   [Paul J. Reder]

  *) BufferLogs are now run-time enabled, and the log_config now has 2 new
     callbacks to allow a 3rd party module to actually do the writing of the
     log file [Ian Holsman]

  *) Correct ISAPIReadAheadBuffer to default to 49152, per mod_isapi docs.
     [André Malo, Astrid Keßler <kess@kess-net.de>]

  *) Fix Segfault in mod_cache. [Kris Verbeeck <Kris.Verbeeck@ubizen.com>]

  *) Change mod_rewrite to use apr-util's dbm support for dbm rewrite
     maps.  The dbm type (e.g., ndbm, gdbm) can be specified on the
     RewriteMap directive.  PR 10644  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fixed mod_rewrite's RewriteMap prg: support so that request/response
     pairs will no longer get out of sync with each other.  PR 9534

  *) Fixes required to get quoted and escaped command args working in
     mod_ext_filter. PR 11793 [Paul J. Reder]

  *) mod-proxy: handle proxied responses with no status lines
     [JD Silvester <jsilves@uwo.ca>, Brett Huttley <brett@huttley.net>]

  *) Fix bug where environment or command line arguments containing 
     non-ASCII-7 characters would cause the Win32 child process creation
     to fail.  PR 11854  [William Rowe]

  *) Bug #11213.. make module loading error messages more informative 
     [Ian Darwin <Ian779@darwinsys.com>]

  *) thread safety & proxy-ftp [Alexey Panchenko alexey@liwest.ru, Ian Holsman]

  *) mod_disk_cache works much better. This module should still
     be considered experimental. [Eric Prud'hommeaux]

  *) Performance improvement for keepalive requests: when setting
     aside a small file for potential concatenation with the next
     response on the connection, set aside the file descriptor rather
     than copying the file into the heap.  [Brian Pane]

  *) Modified version check on openssl so that it finds the executable
     first and then performs a check of the version, only warning the
     user if they chose, or we selected, an old version of OpenSSL.
     This change also allows the code to work for non-openssl libraries
     selected via the --with-ssl=dir option, which can override the
     automated library check in any case.  [Roy Fielding]

Changes with Apache 2.0.40

  *) SECURITY: [CAN-2002-0661] Close a very significant security hole that 
     applies only to the Win32, OS2 and Netware platforms.  Unix was not 
     affected, Cygwin may be affected.  Certain URIs will bypass security
     and allow users to invoke or access any file depending on the system 
     configuration.  Without upgrading, a single .conf change will close 
     the vulnerability.  Add the following directive in the global server
     httpd.conf context before any other Alias or Redirect directives;
         RedirectMatch 400 "\\\.\."
     Reported by Auriemma Luigi <bugtest@sitoverde.com>.
     [Brad Nicholes]

  *) SECURITY:  Close a path-revealing exposure in multiview type
     map negotiation (such as the default error documents) where the
     module would report the full path of the typemapped .var file when
     multiple documents or no documents could be served based on the mime
     negotiation.  Reported by Auriemma Luigi <bugtest@sitoverde.com>.
     [CAN-2002-0654]  [William Rowe]

  *) SECURITY:  Close a path-revealing exposure in cgi/cgid when we 
     fail to invoke a script.  The modules would report "couldn't create 
     child process /path-to-script/script.pl" revealing the full path
     of the script.  Reported by Jim Race <jrace@qualys.com>.
     [CAN-2002-0654]  [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Set aside the apr-iconv and apr_xlate() features for the Win32
     build of 2.0.40 so development can be completed.  A patch, from
     <http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/patches/apply_to_2.0.40/>
     will be available for those that wish to work with apr-iconv.
     [William Rowe]

  *) Fix proxy so that it is possible to access ftp: URLs via a proxy
     chain. [Peter Van Biesen <peter.vanbiesen@vlafo.be>]

  *) mod-deflate now checks to make sure that 'gzip-only-text/html' is
     set to 1, so we can exclude things from the general case with
     browsermatch. [Ian Holsman, Andre Schild <A.Schild@aarboard.ch>]
  
  *) Accept multiple leading /'s for requests within the DocumentRoot.
     PR 10946  [William Rowe, David Shane Holden <dpejesh@yahoo.com>]

  *) Solved the reports of .pdf byterange failures on Win32 alone.
     APR's sendfile for the win32 platform collapses header and trailer
     buffers into a single buffer.  However, we destroyed the pointers
     to the header buffer if a trailer buffer was present.  PR 10781
     [William Rowe]

  *) mod_ext_filter: Add the ability to enable or disable a filter via
     an environment variable.  Add the ability to register a filter of
     type other than AP_FTYPE_RESOURCE.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Restore the ability to specify host names on Listen directives.
     PR 11030.  [Jeff Trawick, David Shane Holden <dpejesh@yahoo.com>]

  *) When deciding on the default address family for listening sockets, 
     make sure we can actually bind to an AF_INET6 socket before
     deciding that we should default to AF_INET6.  This fixes a startup
     problem on certain levels of OpenUNIX.  PR 10235.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Replace usage of atol() to parse strings when we might want a
     larger-than-long value with apr_atoll(), which returns long long.
     This allows HTTPD to deal with larger files correctly.
     [Shantonu Sen <ssen@apple.com>]

  *) mod_ext_filter: Ignore any content-type parameters when checking if
     the response should be filtered.  Previously, "intype=text/html"
     wouldn't match something like "text/html;charset=8859_1".
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) mod_ext_filter: Set up environment variables for external programs.
     [Craig Sebenik <craig@netapp.com>]

  *) Modified the HTTP_IN filter to immediately append the EOS (end of
     stream) bucket for C-L POST bodies, saving a roundtrip and allowing
     the caller to determine that no content remains without prefetching
     additional POST body.  [William Rowe]

  *) Get proxy ftp to work over IPv6.  [Shoichi Sakane <sakane@kame.net>]

  *) Look for OpenSSL libraries in /usr/lib64.  [Peter Poeml <poeml@suse.de>]

  *) Update SuSE layout.  [Peter Poeml <poeml@suse.de>]

  *) Changes to the internationalized error documents:
     Comment them out in the default config file to make the default
     install as simple as possible; Correct the english 500 error to
     be more understandable; Add a Swedish translation.
     [Thomas Sjogren <thomas@northernsecurity.net>, 
      Erik Abele <erik@codefaktor.de>, Rich Bowen, Joshua Slive]
     
  *) Increase the limit on file descriptors per process in apachectl.
     [Brian Pane]

  *) Fix a dependency error when building ApacheMonitor, so that Win32
     and MSVC now trust that the project is current (when it is).
     [James Cox <imajes@php.net>]

  *) mod_ext_filter: don't segfault if content-type is not set.  PR 10617.
     [Arthur P. Smith <apsmith@aps.org>, Jeff Trawick]

  *) APR-Util Renames pending have been completed [Thom May]

  *) Performance improvements for the code that reads request
     headers (ap_rgetline_core() and related functions)  [Brian Pane]

  *) Add a new directive: MaxMemFree.  MaxMemFree makes it possible
     to configure the maximum amount of memory the allocators will
     hold on to for reuse.  Anything over the MaxMemFree threshold
     will be free()d.  This directive is useful when uncommon large
     peaks occur in memory usage.  It should _not_ be used to mask
     defective modules' memory use.  [Sander Striker]

  *) Fixed the Content-Length filter so that HTTP/1.0 requests to CGI
     scripts would not result in a truncated response.
     [Ryan Bloom, Justin Erenkrantz, Cliff Woolley]

  *) Add a filter_init parameter to the filter registration functions
     so that a filter can execute arbitrary code before the handlers
     are invoked.  This resolves a problem where mod_include requests
     would incorrectly return a 304.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Fix a long-standing bug in 2.0, CGI scripts were being called
     with relative paths instead of absolute paths.  Apache 1.3 used
     absolute paths for everything except for SuExec, this brings back
     that standard.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Fix infinite loop due to two HTTP_IN filters being present for
     internally redirected requests.  PR 10146.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Switch conn_rec->keepalive to an enumeration rather than a bitfield.
     [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Fix mod_ext_filter to look in the main server for filter definitions
     when running in a vhost if the filter definition is not found in
     the vhost.  PR 10147  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Support WinNT CGI invocation through ScriptInterpreterSource 
     'registry' for script interpreter paths and names with non-ascii
     characters in the executable filepath.  [William Rowe]

  *) Support the -w flag on to keep the Win32 console open on error.
     [William Rowe]

  *) Normalize the hostname value in the request_rec to all-lowercase
     [Perry Harrington <pedward@webcom.com>]

  *) Fix WinNT cgi 500 errors when QUERY_ARGS or other strings include
     extended characters (non US-ASCII) in non-utf8 format.  This brings
     Win32 back into CGI/1.1 compliance, and leaves charset decoding up
     to the cgi application itself.  [William Rowe]

  *) Major overhaul of mod_dav, mod_dav_fs and the experimental/cache
     modules to bring them up to the current apr/apr-util APIs.
     [William Rowe]

  *) Fix segfault in mod_mem_cache most frequently observed when
     serving the same file to multiple clients on an MP machine.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) mod_rewrite can now set cookies  (RewriteRule (.*) - [CO=name:$1:.domain])
     [Brian Degenhardt <bmd@mp3.com>, Ian Holsman]

  *) Fix perchild to work with apachectl by adding -k support to perchild.
     PR 10074  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix a silly htpasswd.c logic error that incorrectly reported that
     both -c and -n had been used.  PR 9989  [Cliff Woolley]

  *) Fixed a mod_include error case in which no HTTP response was sent
     to the client if an shtml document contained an unterminated SSI
     directive [Brian Pane]

  *) Improve ap_get_client_block implementation by using APR-util brigade
     helper functions and relying on current filter assumptions.
     [Justin Erenkrantz]

Changes with Apache 2.0.39

  *) Fixed a build problem in htpasswd.c on Win32.
     [Guenter Knauf <eflash@gmx.net>, Cliff Woolley]

Changes with Apache 2.0.38

  *) Rewrite htpasswd to use APR.  The removes the annoying warning about
     tmpnam being unsafe.   [Ryan Bloom]

  *) We must set the MIME-type for .shtml files to text/html if we want them
     to be parsed for SSI tags.  Add the config for that to the default 
     config file so that it is easier to enable .shtml parsing.
     [Dave Dyer <ddyer@real-me.net>]

  *) Fixed a problem with 'make install' on ReliantUnix.
     [Jean-frederic Clere <jfrederic.clere@fujitsu-siemens.com>]

  *) Make the default_handler catch all requests that aren't served by
     another handler.  This also gets us to return a 404 if a directory
     is requested, there is no DirectoryIndex, and mod_autoindex isn't
     loaded.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Fixed the handling of nested if-statements in shtml files.
     PR 9866  [Brian Pane]

  *) Allow 'make install DESTDIR=/path'.  This allows packagers to install
     into a directory different from the one that was configured.  This 
     also mirrors the root= feature from 1.3.  We cannot use prefix=,
     because both APR and APR-util resolve their installation paths at 
     configuration time.  This means that there is no variable prefix 
     to replace.  [Andreas Hasenack <andreas@netbank.com.br>]

  *) AIX 4.3.2 and above: Define SINGLE_LISTEN_UNSERIALIZED_ACCEPT.
     These levels of AIX don't have a thundering herd problem with
     accept().  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) prefork MPM: Ignore mutex errors during graceful restart.  For
     certain types of mutexes (particularly SysV semaphores), we
     should expect to occasionally fail to obtain or release the
     mutex during restart processing.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix install-bindist.sh so that it finds any perl instead of just
     early perl 5.x versions.  This is consistent with a build/install
     from source, and it allows the perl scripts installed by a bindist 
     to work on systems with perl 5.6.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix apxs so that the makefile created by "apxs -g" works on AIX and
     Tru64 (and probably some other platforms).  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Allow CGI scripts to return their Content-Length.  This also fixes a
     hang on HEAD requests seen on certain platforms (such as FreeBSD).
     [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Added log rotation based on file size to the RotateLog support
     utility. [Brad Nicholes]

  *) Fix some casting in mod_rewrite which broke random maps.
     PR 9770  [Allan Edwards, Greg Ames, Jeff Trawick]

Changes with Apache 2.0.37

  *) allow POST method over SSL when per-directory client cert
     authentication is used with 'SSLOptions +OptRenegotiate' enabled
     and a client cert was found in the ssl session cache.

  *) 'SSLOptions +OptRengotiate' will use client cert in from the ssl
     session cache when there is no cert chain in the cache.  prior to
     the fix this situation would result in a FORBIDDEN response and
     error message "Cannot find peer certificate chain"
     [Doug MacEachern]

  *) ap_finalize_sub_req_protocol() shouldn't send an EOS bucket if
     one was already sent.  PR 9644  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix the display of the default name for the mime types config
     file.  PR 9729  [Matthew Brecknell <mbrecknell@orchestream.com>]

  *) Fix the working directory *for WinNT/2K/XP services only* to
     change to the Apache directory (one level above the location 
     of Apache.exe, in the case that Apache.exe resides in bin/.)
     Solves the case of ServerRoot /foo paths where /foo was not
     on the same drive as /winnt/system32.  [William Rowe]

  *) Make 2.0's "AcceptMutex" startup message now "completely"
     match how 1.3 does it. [Jim Jagielski]

  *) Implement a fixed size memory cache using a priority queue
     [Ian Holsman]

  *) Fix apxs to allow "apxs -q installbuilddir" and to allow
     querying certain other variables from config_vars.mk.  PR 9316  
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Added the "detached" attribute to the cgi_exec_info_t internals
     so that Win32 and Netware won't create a new window or console
     for each CGI invoked.  PR 8387
     [Brad Nicholes, William Rowe]

  *) Consolidated the command line parameters and attributes that are 
     manipulated by the optional function ap_cgi_build_command() in
     mod_cgi into a single structure.
     [Brad Nicholes]

  *) Get rid of uninitialized value errors with "apxs -q" on certain
     variables.  [Stas Bekman <stas@stason.org>]

  *) Fix apxs to allow it to work when the build directory is somewhere
     besides server-root/build.  PR 8453  
     [Jeff Trawick and a host of others]

  *) Allow ap_discard_request_body to be called multiple times in the
     same request.  Essentially, ap_http_filter keeps track of whether
     it has sent an EOS bucket up the stack, if so, it will only ever
     send an EOS bucket for this request.  
     [Ryan Bloom, Justin Erenkrantz, Greg Stein]

  *) Remove all special mod_ssl URIs.  This also fixes the bug where
     redirecting (.*) will allow an SSL protected page to be viewed
     without SSL.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Fix the binary build install script so that the build logic
     created by "apxs -g" will work when the user has a binary

     - Allow whitespace between the pipe and the name of the
     program in SSLLog "| /path/to/program".  [Cliff Woolley]

  *) Introduce mod_ext_filter and mod_deflate experimental modules

  *) Changes to the worker MPM's queue management and thread
     synchronization code to reduce mutex contention  [Brian Pane]

  *) Don't install *.in configuration files since we already install

  *) Many improvements to the threadpool MPM.  [Aaron Bannert]

  *) Fix subreqs that are promoted via fast_redirect from having invalid

  *) More efficient pool recycling logic for the worker MPM [Brian Pane]

  *) Modify the worker MPM to not accept() new connections until

  *) SECURITY: Added the APLOG_TOCLIENT flag to ap_log_rerror() to
     explicitly tell the server that warning messages should be sent 
     to the client in addition to being recorded in the error log. 
     Prior to this change, ap_log_rerror() always sent warning 
     messages to the client. In one case, a faulty CGI script caused
     the server to send a warning message to the client that contained
     the full path to the CGI script. This could be considered a
     minor security exposure. [Bill Stoddard]

  *) mod_autoindex output when SuppressRules was specified would
     omit the first carriage return so the first item in the list
     would appear to the right of the column headings instead of
     underneath them. PR 8016  [David Shane Holden <dpejesh@yahoo.com>]

  *) Trigger an error when a LoadModule directive attempts to
     load a module which is built-in.  This is a common error when
     switching from a DSO build to a static build.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Change instdso.sh to use libtool --install everywhere and then
     clean up some stray files and symlinks that libtool leaves around
     on some platforms.  This gets subversion building properly since
     it needed a re-link to be performed by libtool at install time,
     and the old instdso.sh logic to simply cp the DSO didn't handle
     that requirement.  [Sander Striker]

  *) Allow VPATH builds to succeed when configured from an empty

  *) Fix segfault in mod_mem_cache when garabge collecting an expired
     cache entry.  [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Introduced -E startup_logfile_name option to httpd to allow admins
     to begin logging errors immediately.  This provides Win32 users 
     an alternative to sending startup errors to the event viewer, and
     allows other daemon tool authors an alternative to logging to stderr.

  *) Proxy was bombing out every second keepalive request, caused by a
     stray CRLF before the second response's status line. Proxy now
     tries to read one more line if it encounters a CRLF where it
     expected a status. PR 10010 [Graham Leggett]

  *) Deprecated the apr_lock.h API. Please see the following files
     for the improved thread and process locking and signaling: 
     apr_proc_mutex.h, apr_thread_mutex.h, apr_thread_rwlock.h,
     apr_thread_cond.h, and apr_global_mutex.h.  [Aaron Bannert]

  *) Change mod_status to use scoreboard accessor functions so it can
     be used in any MPM without having to be recompiled.

  *) Fixes for mod_include errors on boundary conditions in which
     "<!--#" occurs at the very end of a bucket

  *) worker, prefork, perchild, beos MPMs: Add -DFOREGROUND switch to 
     cause the Apache parent process to run in the foreground (similar to
     -DNO_DETACH except that it doesn't switch session ids).  
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Added support for Posix semaphore mutex locking (AcceptMutex posixsem)
     for those platforms that support it. If using the default
     implementation, this is between pthread and sysvsem in priority.
     This implies it's the new default for Darwin. [Jim Jagielski]

  *) AIX: Fix the syntax for setting the LDR_CNTRL and AIXTHREAD_SCOPE
     environment variables in the envvars file.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) worker MPM: Don't create a listener thread until we have a worker
     thread.  Otherwise, in situations where we'll have to wait a while
     to take over scoreboard slots from a previous generation, we'll be
     accepting connections we can't process yet.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Allow worker MPM to build on systems without pthread_kill().

  *) When a proxied site was being served, Apache was replacing

     allowed by RFC2616. Fixed. [Graham Leggett]

  *) Fix a mod_cgid problem that left daemon processes stranded
     in some server restart scenarios.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Added exp_foo and rel_foo variables to config_vars.mk for
     all Apache and Autoconf path variables (like --sysconfdir,
     --sbindir, etc). exp_foo is the "expanded" version, which means
     that all internal variable references have been interpolated.
     rel_foo is the same as $exp_foo, only relative to $prefix if they
     share a common path.  [Aaron Bannert]

  *) Fix some restart/terminate problems in the worker MPM.  Don't
     drop connections during graceful restart.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Change the header merging behaviour in proxy, as some headers
     (like Set-Cookie) cannot be unmerged due to stray commas in

  *) Stop installing libtool for APR and tell APR where it should place
     its copy of libtool (via our installbuildpath layout variable).
     [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) New directive ProxyIOBufferSize. Sets the size of the buffer used
     when reading from a remote HTTP server in proxy. [Graham Leggett]

  *) Modify receive/send loop in proxy_http and proxy_ftp so that
     should it be necessary, the remote server socket is closed before
     transmitting the last buffer (set by ProxyIOBufferSize) to the
     client. This prevents the backend server from being forced to hang
     around while the last few bytes are transmitted to a slow client.
     Fix the case where no error checking was performed on the final
     brigade in the loop. [Graham Leggett]

  *) Scrap CacheMaxExpireMin and CacheDefaultExpireMin. Change
     CacheMaxExpire and CacheDefaultExpire to use seconds rather than
     hours. [Graham Leggett, Bill Stoddard]

  *) New Directive SSIUndefinedEcho. to change the '(none)' echoed
     for a undefined variable. [Ian Holsman]

  *) Proxy HTTP and CONNECT: Keep trying other addresses from the DNS
     when we can't get a socket in the specified address family.  We may
     have gotten back an IPv6 address first and yet our system is not
     configured to allow IPv6 sockets.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Be more careful about recursively removing CVS directories. Make
     sure that we aren't cd'ing to their home directory first. PR: 9993
     [Aaron Bannert, James LewisMoss <dres@lewismoss.net>]

  *) Add a missing errordir entry in the Debian config.layout. PR: 10067
     [Dirk-Jan Faber <dirk-jan@selwerd.nl>, Aaron Bannert,
      Thom May <thom@planetarytramp.net>]

  *) Rename the filter ordering priorities.  The recent filtering fixes
     have showcased problems with their usage.  Therefore, we need to
     rename them to increase the clarity.  (CONTENT->RESOURCE,
     HTTP_HEADER->CONTENT_SET/PROTOCOL)  [Justin Erenkrantz]

Changes with Apache 2.0.33

  *) Fix a problem in the new --enable-layout functionality where
     it wouldn't allow overrides from variables like --prefix,
     --bindir, etc.  [Thom May <thom@planetarytramp.net>]

  *) Fix a bug in the core input filter for AP_MODE_EXHAUSTIVE. It
     no longer hangs around waiting for the socket to close before
     returning exhaustive data.  [Aaron Bannert]

  *) rename apr_exploded_time_t to apr_time_exp_t (as per renames pending)
     [Thom May <thom@planetarytramp.net>]

  *) Change mod_ssl to always do a full startup/teardown on restarts.
     this allows mod_ssl to be added to a server that is already
     running and makes it possible to add/change certs/keys after the
     server has been started.  [Doug MacEachern]

  *) Introduce PassPhraseDialog "|/path/to/pipe" mechanism to mod_ssl.
     This pipe must be a bidirectional 'console' style relay, which
     mod_ssl prints all prompts to the pipe's stdin, and reads the
     passphrases from the pipe's stdout.  [William Rowe]

  *) Fix bug where --sysconfdir and --localstatedir were being
     ignored.  [Thom May <thom@planetarytramp.net>, Aaron Bannert]
     PR 9888

  *) Fix --enable-layout to work again. Caution: When specifying
     --enable-layout, common arguments like --prefix, --exec-prefix,
     etc. will be ignored and the settings from the layout will be
     used instead.  [Thom May <thom@planetarytramp.net>, Aaron Bannert]
     PR 9124, 9873, 9885

  *) New Directive for mod_proxy: ProxyRemoteMatch. This provides
     regex pattern matching for the determination of which requests
     to use the remote proxy for. [Jim Jagielski]

  *) Fix CustomLog bytes-sent with HTTP 0.9.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Prevent Apache from ignoring SIGHUP due to some lingering 1.3
     cruft in piped logs and rewritemap child processes.
     [William Rowe]

  *) All instances of apr_lock_t have been removed and converted
     to one of the following new lock APIs: apr_thread_mutex.h,
     apr_proc_mutex.h, or apr_global_mutex.h. No new code should
     use the apr_lock.h API, as the old API will soon be deprecated.
     [Aaron Bannert]

  *) Merged in changes to mod_ssl up through 2.8.7-1.3.23.
     [Ralf S. Engelschall, Cliff Woolley]

  *) mod-include: make it handle flush'es and fix the 'false-alarm'
     [Justin Erenkrantz, Brian Pane, Ian Holsman]

  *) ap_get_*_filter_handle() functions to allow 3rd party modules
     to lookup filter handles so they can bypass the filter name
     lookup when adding filters to a request (via ap_add_*_filter_handle())
     [Ryan Morgan <rmorgan@covalent.net>]

  *) Fix for multiple file buckets on Win32, where the first file
     bucket would cause the immediate closure of the socket on any
     non-keepalive requests.  [Ryan Morgan <rmorgan@covalent.net>]

  *) Correct Win32 failure of mmap of a segment beyond start of the
     file; fixes large SSL and similar transfers.  [William Rowe]
     PR 9898

  *) Implement apr_proc_detach changes and allow -DNO_DETACH in the
     multi-process mode to not "daemonize" while detaching from the
     controlling terminal. This is necessary for Apache to work with
     process-management tools like AIX's "System Resource Controller"
     as well as Dan Bernstein's "daemontools".
     [Jos Backus <josb@cncdsl.com>, Aaron Bannert]

  *) Convert mod_auth_digest to use the new apr_global_mutex_t
     type.  [Aaron Bannert]

  *) fix bug in mod-include where it wouldn't send a unmatched
     part if it was at the end of a bucket [Ian Holsman]

  *) worker MPM: Improve logging of errors with the interface between
     the listener thread and worker threads.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Some browsers ignore cookies that have been merged into a
     single Set-Cookie header. Set-Cookie and Set-Cookie2 headers
     are now unmerged in the http proxy before being sent to the
     client. [Graham Leggett]

  *) Fix a problem with proxy where each entry of a duplicated
     header such as Set-Cookie would overwrite and obliterate the
     previous value of the header, resulting in multiple header
     values (like cookies) going missing.
     [Graham Leggett, Joshua Slive]

  *) Add the server-limit and thread-limit values to the scoreboard
     for the sake of third-party applications.
     [Adam Sussman <myddryn@vishnu.vidya.com>]

  *) Fix segfault when proxy recieves an invalid HTTP response [Ian Holsman]

  *) OS/390: Get make install to properly copy DSO modules.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Win32: Fix bug in mod_status with displaying "Restart Time"
     and "Server uptime".
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Fix IPv6 name-based virtual hosts.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Introduce AddOutputFilterByType directive.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Fix DEBUG_CGI support in mod_cgi.  PR 9670, 9671.
     [David MacKenzie <djm@pix.net>]

  *) Fix incorrect check for script_in in mod_cgi.  PR 9669.
     [David MacKenzie <djm@pix.net>]

  *) Fix segfault and display error when SSLMutex file can not be
     created.  [Adam Sussman <myddryn@vishnu.vidya.com>]

  *) Add reference counting to mod_mem_cache cache objects to
     better manage removing objects from the cache.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Change the verbage on the ScoreBoardFile in our default configs.
     Also change the default to be commented out (unspecified) so we
     get anonymous shared memory by default.  [Aaron Bannert]

  *) Implement new ScoreBoardFile directive logic. This affects how
     we create the scoreboard's shared memory segment. If the directive
     is present, a name-based segment is created. If the directive is
     not present, first an anonymous segment is created, and if that
     fails, a name-based segment is created from a file of the name
     DEFAULT_SCOREBOARD. This gives third-party applications the
     ability to access our scoreboard.  [Aaron Bannert]

  *) Allow mod_deflate to work with non-GET requests and properly send
     Content-Lengths.  [Sander Striker <striker@apache.org>]

  *) Fix ap_directory_merge() to correctly merge configs when there is
     no <Directory /> block.  [Justin Erenkrantz, William Rowe]

  *) Remove spurious debug messsages that are normal under HTTP
     keep-alive logic.  [Jeff Trawick, Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Fix a bug in mod_cgid that would prevent proper shutdown death
     of the cgid process.  [Aaron Bannert]

  *) Add signal handling back in to the worker MPM for the one_process
     (-X, -DDEBUG, -DONE_PROCESS) case.  [Aaron Bannert]

  *) Performance: Reuse per-connection transaction pools in the
     worker MPM, rather than destroying and recreating them.  [Brian Pane]

  *) Remove all signals from the worker MPM's child process.  Instead,
     the parent uses the Pipe of Death for all communication with the
     child processes.  [Ryan Bloom]

Changes with Apache 2.0.32

  *) mod_negotiation: ForceLanguagePriority now uses 'Prefer' as the
     default if the directive is not specified.  This mirrors older
     behavior without changes to the httpd.conf.  [William Rowe]

  *) Win32: solve the win32 service problems in 2.0.31-alpha, by fixing
     the service, mpm and logging code, and bugs in apr_file_open_stderr 
     and apr_file_dup2 functions.  Win2K/XP services have no handles 
     associated for stdin/out/err, which caused unpredictable behavior
     in the prior release.  [William Rowe, Bill Stoddard]

  *) Win32: simplify the Application Event Log messages, since there isn't
     likely to be 'more information in the error log' before an error log
     has been opened.  [William Rowe]

  *) Win32: substantial cleanup to the mpm_winnt code for legibility and
     to follow the program flow of other MPMs.  [Ryan Bloom, William Rowe]

  *) Win32: apache -k shutdown now behaves like apache -k stop.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Fix prefork to not kill the parent if a child hits a resource shortage
     on accept().  [Greg Ames]

  *) Fix seg faults that occur when what should be the httpd request line
     starts with \r\n followed by garbage.  [Greg Ames]

  *) Allow statically linked support binaries with the new
     --enable-static-support flag, and enable this behavior in
     the binbuild script. Also add a new --enable-static-htdbm
     flag.  [Aaron Bannert]

  *) Allow mod_autoindex to serve symlinks if permitted and attempt to
     do only one stat() call when generating the directory listings.
     [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Fix resolve_symlink to save the original symlink name if known.
     [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Be a bit more sane with regard to CanonicalNames.  If the user has
     specified they want to use the CanonicalName, but they have not
     configured a port with the ServerName, then use the same port that 
     the original request used. [Ryan Bloom and Ken Coar]

  *) In core_input_filter, check for an empty brigade after 
     APR_BRIGADE_NORMALIZE().  Otherwise, we can get segfaults if a
     client says it will post some data but we get FIN before any
     data arrives.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Not being able to bind to the socket is a fatal error.  We should
     print an error to the console, and return a non-zero status code.
     With these changes, all of the Unix MPMs do that correctly.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) suexec: Allow HTTPS and SSL_* environment variables to be passed
     through to CGI scripts. PR 9163
     [Brian Reid <breid@customlogic.com>, 
      Zvi Har'El <rl@math.technion.ac.il>]

  *) binbuild.sh: Make sure that we use the expat from our source
     tree so that there aren't any surprises on the target machine.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) mod_cgid: Add retry logic for when the daemon can't fork fast
     enough to keep up with new requests.  Start using 
     HTTP_SERVER_UNAVAILABLE instead of HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR
     when we can't talk to the daemon.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) apxs: LTFLAGS envvar can override default libtool options.  Try
     "LTFLAGS=' ' apxs -c mod_foo.c" to see what libtool does under
     the covers.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) The Location: response header field, used for external
     redirect, *must* be an absoluteURI.  The Redirect directive
     tested for that, but RedirectMatch didn't -- it would allow
     almost anything through.  Now it will try to turn an abs_path
     into an absoluteURI, but it will correctly varf like Redirect
     if the final redirection target isn't an absoluteURI.  [Ken Coar]

Changes with Apache 2.0.31

  *) Create the scoreboard (in the parent) in a global pool context,
     so it survives graceful restarts. This fixes a SEGV during
     graceful restarts.  [Aaron Bannert]

  *) Add a timeout option to the proxy code 'ProxyTimeout' 
     [Ian Holsman]

  *) FTP directory listings are now always retrieved in ASCII mode.
     The FTP proxy properly escapes URI's and HTML in the generated
     listing, and escapes the path components when talking to the FTP
     server. It is now possible to browse the root directory by using
     a url like:   ftp://user@host/%2f/ (ported from apache_1.3.24)
     Also, the last path component may contain wildcard characters
     '*' and '?', and if they do, a directory listing is created instead
     of a file retrieval. Example: ftp://user@host/httpd/server/*.c
     [Martin Kraemer]

  *) Added single-listener unserialized accept support to the
     worker MPM [Brian Pane]

  *) New Directive for mod_proxy: 'ProxyPreserveHost'. This passes
     the incoming host header through to the proxied server
     [Geoff <g.russell@ieee.org>]

  *) New Directive Option for ProxyPass. It now can block a location
     from being proxied [Jukka Pihl <jukka.pihl@entirem.com>]

  *) Don't let the default handler try to serve a raw directory.  At
     best you get gibberish.  Much worse things can happen depending
     on the OS.  [Jeff Trawick]
     
  *) Change the pre_config hook to return a value. Modules can now emit
     an error message and then cause the server to quit gracefully during
     startup. This required a bump to the MMN.  [Aaron Bannert]

  *) Fix some unix socket descriptor leaks in the handler side of
     mod_cgid (the part that runs in the server process).  Whack a
     silly "close(-1)" in the handler too.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Change the pre_mpm hook to return a value, so that scoreboard
     init errors percolate up to code that knows how to exit 
     cleanly.  This required a bump to the MMN.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Add the socket back to the conn_rec and remove the create_connection
     hook. The create_connection hook had a design flaw that did not 
     allow creating connections based on vhost info. [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Fixed PATH_INFO and QUERY_STRING from mod_negotiation results.
     Resolves the common case of using negotation to resolve the request
     /script/foo for /script.cgi/foo.  [William Rowe]

  *) Added new functions ap_add_(input|output)_filter_handle to
     allow modules to bypass the usual filter name lookup when
     adding hard-coded filters to a request [Brian Pane]

  *) caching should now work on subrequests (still very experimental)
     [Ian Holsman]
  
  *) The Win32 mpm_winnt now has a shared scoreboard.  [William Rowe]

  *) Change ap_get_brigade prototype to use apr_off_t instead of apr_off_t*.
     [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Refactor ap_rgetline so that it does not use an internal brigade.
     Change ap_rgetline's prototype to return errors.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Remove mod_auth_db.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Do not install unnecessary pcre headers like config.h and internal.h.
     [Joe Orton <joe@manyfish.co.uk>]

  *) Change in quick_hanlder behavior for subrequests. it now passes DONE
     (as it does for a normal request). quick_handled sub-requests now work
     in mod-include [Ian Holsman]

  *) Change SUBREQ_CORE so that it is a 'HTTP_HEADER' filter instead of
     'CONTENT' one, as it needs to run AFTER all content headers

  *) Rename BeOS MPM directive RequestsPerThread to MaxRequestsPerThread.
     [Lars Eilebrecht]

  *) Split out blocking from the mode in the input filters.
     [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Fix a segfault in mod_include.  [Justin Erenkrantz, Jeff Trawick]

  *) Cause Win32 to capture all child-worker process errors in
     Apache to the main server error log, until the child can
     open its own error logs.  [William Rowe]

  *) HPUX 11.*: Do not kill the child process when accept() 
     returns ENOBUFS on HPUX 11.*. (ported from a 1.3 patch
     by [madhusudan_mathihalli@hp.com])
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Fix a problem in the parsing of the <Proxy foo> directive.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) rewrite of mod_ssl input filter for better performance and less
     memory usage [Doug MacEachern]

  *) allow quick_handler to be run on subrequests. [Ian Holsman]

  *) mod_dav now asks its provider to place content directly into the
     filter stack when handling a GET request. The mod_dav/provider
     API has changed, so providers need to be updated. [Greg Stein]

  *) Clear the output socket descriptor in unixd_accept() to make sure
     we don't supply a bogus socket to the caller if the accept fails.
     This caused problems with the worker MPM, which tried to process
     the returned socket if it was non-NULL.  [Brian Pane]

  *) Move a check for an empty brigade to the start of core input filter
     to avoid segfaults.  [Justin Erenkrantz, Jeff Trawick]

  *) Add FileETag directive to allow configurable control of what
     data are used to form ETag values for file-based URIs.  MMN
     bumped to 20020111 because of fields added to the end of
     the core_dir_config structure.  [Ken Coar]

  *) Fix a segfault in mod_rewrite's logging code caused by passing the
     wrong config to ap_get_remote_host().  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Allow mod_cgid to work from a binary distribution install by
     using 755 for the permissions on the log directory instead of
     750.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fixed a segfault that happened during graceful shutdown (or when
     the httpd ran out of file descriptors) with the worker MPM [Brian Pane]

  *) Split all Win32 modules [excluding the core components mod_core, 
     mod_so, mod_win32 and the winnt mpm] into individual loadable
     modules, so the administrator may individually disable the former
     compiled-in modules by simply commenting out their LoadModule
     directives.  [William Rowe]

  *) Saved Win32 module authors and porters many future headaches, by
     duplicating the appropriate .h files such as os.h into the include
     directory, including in the build tree.  [William Rowe]

  *) mod_ssl adjustments to help with using toolkits other than OpenSSL:
      Use SSL functions/macros instead of directly dereferencing SSL
      structures wherever possible.
      Add type-casts for the cases where functions return a generic pointer.
      Add $SSL/include to configure search path.
     [Madhusudan Mathihalli <madhusudan_mathihalli@hp.com>]

  *) Moved several pointers out of the shared Scoreboard so it is
     more portable, and will present the vhost name across server
     generation restarts.  [William Rowe]

  *) Fix SSLPassPhraseDialog exec: and SSLRandomSeed exec:
     [Doug MacEachern]

Changes with Apache 2.0.30

  *) Fix the main bug for FreeBSD and threaded MPM's. There are
     still issues (see STATUS) but at least the server will now
     run without crashing the machine.
     [David Reid, Aaron Bannert, Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Fix a typo in mod_deflate's m4 config section.
     [albert chin (china@thewrittenword.com)]

  *) Fix a couple of mod_proxy problems forwarding HTTP connections
     and handling CONNECT:
     (1) PR #9190  Proxy failed to connect to IPv6 hosts.
     (2) Proxy failed to connect when the first IP address returned by 
         the resolver was unreachable but a secondary IP address was.  
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix the module identifer as shown in the docs for various core
     modules (e.g., the identifer for mod_log_config was previously
     listed as config_log_module).  PR #9338
     [James Watson <ap2bug@sowega.org>]

  *) Fix LimitRequestBody directive by placing it in the HTTP
     filter.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Fix mod_proxy seg fault when the proxied server returns 
     an HTTP/0.9 response or a bogus status line.
     [Adam Sussman]

  *) Prevent mod_proxy from truncating one character off the
     end of the status line returned from the proxied server.
     [Adam Sussman, Bill Stoddard]

  *) Eliminate loop in ap_proxy_string_read().
     [Adam Sussman, Bill Stoddard]

  *) Provide $0..$9 results from mod_include regex parsing.
     [William Rowe]

  *) Allow mod-include to look for alternate start & end tags [Ian Holsman]

  *) Introduced the ForceLanguagePriority directive, to prevent
     returning MULTIPLE_CHOICES or NONE_ACCEPTABLE in some cases,
     when using Multiviews.  [William Rowe]

  *) Fix a problem which prevented mod_cgid and suexec from working
     together reliably [Greg Ames]

  *) Remove the call to exit() from within mod_auth_digest's post_config
     phase.  [Aaron Bannert]

  *) Fix a problem in mod_auth_digest that could potentially cause
     problems with initialized static data on a system that uses DSOs.
     [Aaron Bannert]

  *) Fix a segfault in the worker MPM that could happen during
     child process exits.  [Brian Pane, Aaron Bannert]

  *) Allow mod_auth_dbm to handle multiple DBM types [Ian Holsman]

  *) Fix matching of vhosts by ip address so we find IPv4
     vhost address when target address is v4-mapped form of
     that address.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) More performance tweaks to the BNDM string-search algorithm
     used to find "<!--#" tokens in mod_include [Brian Pane]

  *) Miscellaneous small performance fixes: optimized away various
     string copy operations and removed large temp buffers from
     the stack [Brian Pane]

  *) Fixed startup segfault that occurred when a VirtualHost
     directive had a port but no address [Brian Pane]

  *) Allow htdbm to work with multiple DBM types [Ian Holsman]

  *) Win32: Made change to apr_sendfile() to return APR_ENOTIMPL
     if oslevel < WINNT.  This should fix several problems reported
     Against 2.0.28 on Windows 98 [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Win32: Fix bug that could cause CGI scripts with QUERY_STRINGS
     to fail. [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Change core code to allow an MPM to set hard thread/server
     limits at startup.  prefork, worker, and perchild MPMs now have 
     directives to set these limits.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Win32: The async AcceptEx() event should be autoreset upon
     successful completion of a wait (WaitForSingleObject). This
     eliminates a number of spurious
     setsockopt(SO_UPDATE_ACCEPT_CONTEXT) failed." messages.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Move any load library path environment variables out of 
     apachectl and into a separate environment variable file which
     can be more easily tailored by the admin.  The environment
     variable file as built by Apache may have additional system-
     specific settings.  For example, on OS/390 we tailor the heap
     settings to allow lots of threads.  [Jeff Trawick]
    
  *) Use the new APR pool code to reduce pool-related lock
     contention in the worker MPM.  [Sander Striker]

  *) The POD no longer assumes the child is listening on 127.0.0.1
     and now pulls the first hostname in the list of listeners to
     perform the dummy connect on. This fixes a bug when the user
     had configured the Listen directive for an IP other than
     127.0.0.1. This would result in undead children and error
     messages such as "Connection refused: connect to listener".
     [Aaron Bannert]

  *) The worker MPM now respects the LockFile setting, needed to
     avoid locking problems with NFS.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix segfault when worker MPM receives SIGHUP.
     [Ian Holsman, Aaron Bannert, Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Fix bug that could potentially prevent the perchild MPM from
     working with more than one vhost/uid.  [Aaron Bannert]

  *) Change make install and apxs -i processing of DSO modules to 
     perform special handling on platforms where libtool doesn't install 
     mod_foo.so.  This fixes some wonkiness on HP-UX, Tru64, and AIX 
     which prevented standard LoadModule statements from working.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Whenever mod_so is enabled (not just when there are DSOs for
     our modules), do whatever special magic is required for compiling/
     loading third-party modules.  This allows third-party DSOs to
     be used on an AIX build when there were no built-in modules
     built as DSOs.  (This should help on OS/390 and BeOS as well.)
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Allow apxs to be used to build DSOs on AIX without requiring the
     user to hard-code the list of import files.  (This should help
     on OS/390 and BeOS as well.)  [Jeff Trawick]
     
  *) Resolved segfault in mod_isapi when configuring with ISAPICacheFile.
     PR 8563, 8919  [William Rowe]
  
  *) Get binary builds working when libapr and libaprutil are built
     shared [Greg Ames]

  *) Get shared builds of libapr and libaprutil, as well as Apache DSOs,
     working on AIX.  [Aaron Bannert, Dick Dunbar <RLDunbar@pacbell.net>,
     Gary Hook <ghook@us.ibm.com>, Victor Orlikowski, Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix the handling of SSI directives in which the ">" of the
     terminating "-->" is the last byte in a file [Brian Pane]

  *) Add back in the "suEXEC mechanism enabled (wrapper: /path/to/suexec)"
     message that we had back in apache-1.3 and still have scattered
     throughout our docs.  [Aaron Bannert]

  *) Prevent the Win32 port from continuing after encountering an
     error in the command line args to apache.  [William Rowe]

  *) On a error in the proxy, make it write a line to the error log
     [Ian Holsman]

  *) Various mod_ssl performance improvements [Doug MacEachern]

Changes with Apache 2.0.29

  *) Add buffering in core_output_filter to ensure that long
     lists of small buckets don't cause small packet writes.
     [Brian Pane, Ryan Bloom]

  *) Fix the installation target to make sure that the manual is 
     installed in the correct location.
     [Yoshifumi Hiramatsu <hiramatu@boreas.dti.ne.jp> and
      Gomez Henri <hgomez@slib.fr>]

  *) Fix the cmd command for mod_include.  When we are processing
     a cmd command, we do not want to use the r->filename to set
     the command name.  The command comes from the SSI tag.  To do this,
     I added a variable to the function that builds the command line
     in mod_cgi.  This allows the include_cmd function to specify
     the command line itself. [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Change open_logs hook to return a value, allowing you
     to flag a error while opening logs
     [Ian Holsman, Doug MacEachern]

  *) Change post_config hook to return a value, allowing you
     to flag a error post config
     [Ian Holsman, Jeff Trawick]

  *) Allow SUEXEC_BIN (the path to the suexec binary that is
     hard-coded into the server) to be specified to the configure
     script by the --with-suexec-bin parameter.  [Aaron Bannert]

  *) Fix segv in worker MPM following accept on pipe-of-death
     [Brian Pane]

  *) Add mod_deflate to experimental.  
     [Ian Holsman, Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Bail out at configure time if an invalid MPM was specified.
     [jean-frederic clere <jfrederic.clere@fujitsu-siemens.com>]

  *) Prevent segv in ap_note_basic_auth_failure() when no AuthName is
     configured [John Sterling <sterling@covalent.net>]

  *) Fix apxs to use sbindir.  [Henri Gomez <hgomez@slib.fr>]

  *) Fix a problem with IPv6 vhosts.  PR #8118  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Optimization for the BNDM string-search function in
     mod_include.  [Brian Pane]

  *) Fixed the behavior of the XBitHack directive.
     [Taketo Kabe <kabe@sra-tohoku.co.jp>, Cliff Woolley] PR#8804

  *) The threaded MPM for Unix has been removed.  Use the worker
     MPM instead.  [various]

  *) APR-ize the resolver logic in mod_unique_id.  This fixes a bug
     in logging the error from a failed DNS lookup.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Added the missing macros AP_INIT_TAKE13 and AP_INIT_TAKE123.
     [Cliff Woolley]

  *) Get mod_cgid killed when a MPM exits due to a fatal error.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix a file descriptor leak in mod_include.  When we include a
     file, we use a sub-request, but we didn't destroy the sub-request
     immediately, instead we waited until the original request was
     done.  This patch closes the sub-request as soon as the data is
     done being generated.  [Brian Pane <bpane@pacbell.net>]

  *) Allow modules that add sockets to the ap_listeners list to
     define the function that should be used to accept on that
     socket.  Each MPM can define their own function to use for
     the accept function with the MPM_ACCEPT_FUNC macro.  This
     also abstracts out all of the Unix accept error handling
     logic, which has become out of synch across Unix MPMs.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Fix a bug which would cause the response headers to be omitted
     when sending a negotiated ErrorDocument because the required
     filters were attached to the wrong request_rec.
     [John Sterling <sterling@covalent.net>]

  *) Remove commas from the end of the macros that define
     directives that are used by MPMs.  Prior to this patch,
     you would use these macros without commas, which was unlike
     the macros for any other directives.  Now, the caller provides
     the comma rather than the macro providing it.  This makes
     the macros look more like the rest of the directives.
     [Ryan Bloom and Cliff Woolley]

  *) Add 'redirect-carefully' environment option to disable sending
     redirects under special circumstances.  This is helpful for 
     Microsoft's WebFolders when accessing a directory resource via
     DAV methods.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Begin to abstract out the underlying transport layer.
     The first step is to remove the socket from the conn_rec,
     the server now lives in a context that is passed to the
     core's input and output filters. This forces us to be very
     careful when adding calls that use the socket directly,
     because the socket isn't available in most locations.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Really reset the MaxClients value in worker and threaded
     when the configured value is not a multiple of the number 
     of threads per child.  We said we did previously but we 
     forgot to. [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Add Debian layout.  [Daniel Stone <daniel@sfarc.net>]

  *) If shared modules are requested and mod_so is not available,
     produce a fatal config-time error.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Improve http2env's performance by cutting the work it has to
     do.  [Brian Pane <bpane@pacbell.net>]

  *) use new 'apr_hash_merge' function in mod_mime (performance fix)
     [Brian Pane <bpane@pacbell.net>]

Changes with Apache 2.0.28

  *) Fix infinite loop in mod_cgid.c.  
     [Dale Ghent <daleg@elemental.org>, Brian Pane <bpane@pacbell.net>]

  *) When no port is given in a "ServerName host" directive, the
     server_rec->port is now set to zero, not 80. That allows for
     run-time deduction of the correct server port (depending on
     SSL/plain, and depending also on the current setting of
     UseCanonicalName). This change makes redirections
     work, even with https:// connections. As in Apache-1.3, the
     connection's actual port number is never used, only the ServerName
     setting or the client's Host: setting. Documentation updated
     to reflect the change. [Martin Kraemer]

  *) Add a '%{note-name}e' argument to mod-headers, which works in
     the same way as mod_log_confg.  [Ian Holsman]

  *) Fix the spelling of the AP_MPMQ_MIN_SPARE_DAEMONS and
     AP_MPMQ_MAX_REQUESTS_DAEMON macros in ap_mpm.h and all standard
     MPMs.  [Cliff Woolley]

  *) Introduce htdbm, a user management utility for db/dbm authorization
     databases.  [Mladen Turk <mturk@mappingsoft.com>]

  *) Optimize usage of strlen and strcat in ap_directory_walk.
     [Brian Pane <bpane@pacbell.net>]

Changes with Apache 2.0.27

  *) Introduce an Apache mod_ssl initial configuration template 
     (ssl.conf, generated from ssl-std.conf).  [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Fixed a memory leak in the getline parsing code that could
     be triggered by arbitrarily large header lines. Requests
     from the core input filter for single lines are now limited
     to HUGE_STRING_LEN (8192 bytes).  [Aaron Bannert]

  *) Fix a truncation bug in how we print the port on the Via: header. 
     The routine that prints the Via: header now takes a length for
     the port string.  [Zvi Har'El <rl@math.technion.ac.il>]

  *) Some syntax errors in mod_mime_magic's magic file can result
     in a 500 error, which previously was unlogged.  Now we log the
     error.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Add the support/checkgid helper app, which checks the run-time
     validity of group identifiers usable in the Group directive.
     [Ken Coar]

  *) Various --enable-so options have been fixed: --enable-so is
     treated as "static"; explicit --enable-so=shared issues an error;
     and explicit --enable-so fails with error on systems without
     APR_HAS_DSO.  [Aaron Bannert]

  *) Fix a segfault in the core input filter when the client socket
     gets disconnected unexpectedly.  [Cliff Woolley]

  *) Fix the reporting for child processes that die.  This removes
     all of the non-portable W* macros from Apache. 
     [Jeff Trawick and Ryan Bloom]

  *) Win32: Track and display "Parent Server Generation:" in
     mod_status output. The generation will be bumped at
     server graceful restart, when the child process exits
     by hitting MaxRequestsPerChild or if the child 
     process exits abnormally. [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Win32: Fix problem where MaxRequestsPerChild directive was
     not being picked up in favor of the default. Enable
     the parent to start up a new child process immediately upon
     the old child starting shutdown.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Fix some bungling of the remote port in rfc1413.c so that 
     IdentityCheck retrieves the proper user id instead of failing
     and thus always returning "nobody."  
     [Dick Streefland <Dick.Streefland@xs4all.nl>]

  *) Introduced thread saftey for mod_rewrite's internal cache.
     [Brian Pane <bpane@pacbell.net>]

  *) Simplified mod_env's directives to behave as most directives are
     expected, in that UnsetEnv will not unset a SetEnv and PassEnv 
     directive following that UnsetEnv within the same container.
     Also provides a runtime startup warning if a PassEnv configured 
     environment value is undefined.  [William Rowe]

  *) The worker MPM is now completely ported to APR's new lock API. It
     uses native APR types for thread mutexes, cross-process mutexes,
     and condition variables.  [Aaron Bannert]

  *) Sync up documentation to remove all references to the now deprecated
     Port directive.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Moved all ldap modules from the core to httpd-ldap sub-project
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Exit when we can't listen on any of the configured ports.  This
     is the same behavior as 1.3, and it avoids having the MPMs to
     deal with bogus ap_listen_rec structures.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Cleanup the proxy code that creates a request to the origin
     server.  This change adds an optional hook, which allows modules
     to gain control while the request is created if the proxy module
     is loaded.  The purpose of this hook is to allow modules to add
     input and/or output filters to the request to the origin.  While
     I was at it, I made the core use this hook, so that proxy request
     creation uses some of the code from the core.  This can still be
     greatly improved, but this is a good start.  [Ryan Bloom]

Changes with Apache 2.0.26

  *) Port the MaxClients changes from the worker MPM to the threaded
     MPM.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Fix mod_proxy so that it handles chunked transfer-encoding and works
     with the new input filtering system.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Introduce the MultiviewsMatch directive, to allow the operator
     to be flexible in recognizing Handlers and Filters filename
     extensions as part of the Multiviews matching logic, strict with
     MultiviewsMatch NegotiatedOnly to accept only filename extentions 
     that designate negotiated parameters, (content type, charset, etc.)
     or MultiviewsAll for the 1.3 behavior of matching any files, even
     if they have unregistered extensions.  [William Rowe]

  *) Fixed the configure script to add a LoadModule directive to
     the default httpd.conf for any module that was compiled
     as a DSO.  [Aaron Bannert <aaron@clove.org>]

  *) rewrite mod_ssl input filtering to work with the new input filtering
     system.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) prefork: Don't segfault when we are able to listen on some but
     not all of the configured ports.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Build mod_so even if no core modules are built shared.
     [Aaron Bannert <aaron@clove.org>]

  *) Introduce ap_directory_walk rewrite (with further optimizations
     required) to adapt to the ap_process_request_internal() changes.
     Optimized so subrequests and redirects now reuse previous section 
     merges, until we mismatch with the original directory_walk, and
     precomputed r->finfo results will cause directory_walk to skip
     the most expensive phases of the function.  [William Rowe]

  *) Allow ApacheMonitor to connect to and control Apache on other 
     WinNT/2K machines.   [Mladen Turk <mturk@mappingsoft.com>]

  *) Remove the Port directive.  In it's place, the Listen directive
     is now a required directive, which tells Apache what port to
     listen on.  The ServerName directive has also been extended
     to accept an optional port.  If the port is specified to the
     ServerName, the server will report that port whenever it
     reports the port that it is listening on.  This change was
     made to ease configuration errors that stem from having a Port
     directive, and a Listen directive.  In that situation, the server
     would only listen to the port specified by the Listen command,
     which caused a lot of confusion to users.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Added mod_mime_magic, mod_unique_id and mod_vhost_alias to the Win32
     build, as loadable modules.  [William Rowe]

  *) Fix --enable-mods-shared processing.  If most is specified,
     then all modules that can be compiled as shared modules are.
     [Aaron Bannert <aaron@clove.org>]

  *) Update the mime.types file to map video/vnd.mpegurl to mxu
     and add commonly used audio/x-mpegurl for m3u extensions.        
     [Heiko Recktenwald <uzs106@uni-bonn.de>, Lars Eilebrecht]

  *) Eliminate the depreciated r->content_language, in favor of the array
     r->content_languages introduced many years ago.  Module authors must
     substantially overhaul their modules, so this needs to be upgraded
     if the module still relied on backwards-brokeness.  [William Rowe]

  *) Allow configure help strings to work with autoconf 2.50+ and 2.13.
     [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Rewrite the input filtering mechanisms to consolidate and reorganize
     code.  In short, core_input_filter does something now and
     ap_http_filter is now only concerned with HTTP.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Update the Win32 build to re-absorb mod_proxy and family.
     [William Rowe]

  *) Resolved the build failure on Win32 using MSVC 5.0 (without the
     current SDK.)  [William Rowe]

  *) Some style changes to the code that does ProxyErrorOverride. Fixed
     config merge behaviour. [Graham Leggett]

  *) Allow support programs to be compiled against a static version
     of libapr.  This allows the smaller support programs to be 
     relocated.  [Aaron Bannert <aaron@clove.org>]

  *) Update the mime.types file to the registered media types as
     of 2001-09-25, and add mapping for xsl extension [Mark Cox]

  *) Fix MaxClients in the Worker MPM, so that it specifies the maximum
     number of clients that can connect at the same time, instead of
     specifying the maximum number of child processes.
     [Aaron Bannert <aaron@clove.org>]

  *) Switch proc_pthread AcceptMutex configuration directive to pthread to 
     be consistent with 1.3.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Cache apr_explode_localtime() value for 15 seconds.
     [Brian Pane <bpane@pacbell.net>]

  *) Fix mod_include to not return ETag or Last-Modified headers.
     [Ian Holsman <ianh@cnet.com>]

  *) Fix worker MPM's scoreboard logic.  [Aaron Bannert <aaron@clove.org>]

  *) Eliminate the wasteful run-time conversion of method names from strings 
     to numbers in places where the methods are known at compile time.  
     [Brian Pane <bpane@pacbell.net>]

  *) Turn the worker MPM's queue into a LIFO.  This may
     improve cache-hit performance under some conditions.
     [Aaron Bannert <aaron@clove.org>]

  *) Switch back to SIGUSR1 for graceful restarts on all platforms that
     support it.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Cleanup the worker MPM.  We no longer re-use transaction
     pools.  This incurs less overhead than shuffling the pools
     around so that they can be re-used.  Remove one of the
     queue's condition variables.  We just redefined the API to
     state that you can't try to add more stuff than you allocated
     segments for.  [Aaron Bannert <aaron@clove.org>]

  *) Fix SSL VPATH builds [Cody Sherr <csherr@covalent.net>]

  *) Fixed persistent connections when a request contains a body.
     [Greg Stein]

  *) mod_dav uses a new API to speak to the backend provider for dead
     property management. [Greg Stein]

  *) Remove the Win32 script-processing exception from mod_cgi, and
     roll build_command_line/build_argv_list into a unified, overrideable
     ap_cgi_build_command optional function.  [William Rowe]

  *) Rewrite find_start_sequence to use a better search algorithm
     to find the start tag.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Fix a seg fault in mod_include.  When we are generating an
     internal redirect, we must set r->uri to "", not a bogus
     string, and not NULL.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Optimized location_walk, so subrequests, redirects and second passes
     now reuse previous section merges on a <Location > by <Location >
     basis, until we mismatch with the original location_walk. 
     [William Rowe]

  *) Back out the 1.45 change to util_script.c.  This change made
     us set the environment variable REQUEST_URI to the redirected
     URI, instead of the originally requested URI.
     [Taketo Kabe <kabe@sra-tohoku.co.jp>]

  *) Make mod_include do lazy evaluation of potentially expensive to
     compute variables.  [Brian Pane <bpane@pacbell.net>]

  *) Fix logging of bytes sent for HEAD requests.  %b and %B should
     log either - or 0, before this patch, they were both logging
     the file size.  [Taketo Kabe <kabe@sra-tohoku.co.jp>]

  *) Make mod_include check for BYTE_CHECK_THRESHOLD per bucket rather 
     than per character.  [Brian Pane <bpane@pacbell.net>]

  *) Normalize the primary request, redirects and sub-requests to
     run the same ap_process_request_internal for consistency in
     robustness, behavior and security.  [William Rowe]

  *) Fix a segfault with mod_include when r->path_info is not set
     (which is the case with mod_proxy).  [Ian Holsman <ianh@cnet.com>]

  *) Add -X functionality back.  This indicates to all MPMs and any other
     part of Apache that it should run in "debug" mode.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Some initial support for the cygwin platform [prefork only].
     This is not to be confused with support for the WinNT/Win32
     platform, which is the recommended configuration for native
     Win32 users.  The cygwin platform support is recommended for
     cygwin platform users. [Stipe Tolj <tolj@wapme-systems.de>]

  *) Changed syntax of Set{Input|Output}Filter.  The list of filters
     must be semicolon delimited (if more than one filter is given.)
     The Set{Input|Output}Filter directive now overrides a parent
     container's directive (e.g. SetInputFilter in <Directory /web/foo>
     will override any SetInputFilter directive in <Directory /web>.)
     This new syntax is more consistent with Add{Input|Output}Filter
     directives defined in mod_mime.  Also cures a bug in prior releases
     where the Set{Input|Output}Filter directive would corrupt the 
     global configuration if the multiple directives were nested.
     [William Rowe]

  *) Cured what's ailed mime for quite some time.  If an AddSomething
     was given in the configuration (Language, Charset, Handler or
     Encoding) Apache would set the content type as given by AddType, 
     but refused to check the mime.types file if AddType wasn't given 
     for that specific extension.  Setting the AddHandler for .html 
     without setting the AddType text/html html would cause Apache to 
     use the default content type.  [William Rowe]

  *) Added some bulletproofing to memory allocation in the LDAP cache
     code. [Graham Leggett]

Changes with Apache 2.0.25

  *) Move the installed /manual directory out of the /htdocs/ tree, so
     that it can be kept more independently from the remaining document
     root. The "Alias /manual ..." already allowed for easy projection
     into existing private document trees. [Martin Kraemer]

  *) Add specified user attributes to the environment when using
     mod_auth_ldap. This allows you to use mod_include to embed specified
     user attributes in a page like so:
     Hello <!--#echo var="AUTHENTICATE_CN"-->, how are you?
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) Fix a performance problem with the worker MPM.  We now create
     transaction pools once, and re-use them for each connection.
     [Aaron Bannert <aaron@clove.org>]

  *) Modfied mod_mime to prevent mod_negotation from serving a multiview
     of a 'handler' or 'filter', so that any filename extension that does 
     not contribute to the negotiated metadata can't be served without
     an explicit request.  E.g., if the .Z extension is associated with
     an unzip filter, the user request somefile.Z.html, mod_negotiation
     won't serve it.  It can serve somefile.Z.html when somefile.Z is
     requested, since the .Z extension is explictly requested, if the
     .html extension is associated with ContentType text/html.
     [William Rowe]

  *) Introduce the AddInputFilter filter[;filter...] ext [ext...]
     and corresponding AddOutputFilter syntax, to insert one or more 
     filters by mod_mime filename extension processing.
     [William Rowe]

  *) Fix a growing connection pool in core_output_filter() for 
     keepalive requests.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Moved split_and_pass_pretag_buckets back to being a
     macro at Ryans's request. Removed the return from it
     by setting and returning a return code instead. Updated
     the code to check the return code from the macro and
     do the right thing. [Paul J. Reder]

  *) Fix a segfault when a numeric value was received for Host:.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Add a function ap_remove_input_filter.  This is to match
     up with ap_remove_output_filter.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Clean up location_walk, so that this step performs a minimum
     amount of redundant effort (it must be run twice, but it will no
     longer reparse all <Location > blocks when the request uri
     hadn't changed.)  [William Rowe]

  *) Eliminate proxy: (and all other 'special') processing from the
     ap_directory_walk() phase.  Modules that want to use special
     walk logic should refer to the mod_proxy map_to_location example,
     with it's proxy_walk and proxysection implementation.  This makes
     either directory_walk flavor much more legible, since that phase
     only runs against real <Directory > blocks.
     [William Rowe]

  *) SECURITY: Fix a security problem in mod_include which would allow
     an SSI document to be passed to the client unparsed.
     [Cliff Woolley, Brian Pane]

  *) Introduce the map_to_storage hook, which allows modules to bypass
     the directory_walk and file_walk for non-file requests.  TRACE
     shortcut moved to http_protocol.c as APR_HOOK_MIDDLE, and the
     directory_walk/file_walk happen as APR_HOOK_VERY_LAST in core.c.
     [William Rowe]

  *) Add the ability for mod_include to add the INCLUDES filter
     if the file is configured for the server-parsed handler.
     This makes the configuration for .shtml files much easier
     to understand, and allows mod_include to honor Apache 1.3
     config files.   Based on Doug MacEachern's patch to PHP
     to do the same thing.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) force OpenSSL to ignore process local-caching and to always
     get/set/delete sessions using mod_ssl's callbacks
     [Madhusudan Mathihalli <madhusudan_mathihalli@hp.com>,
      Geoff Thorpe <geoff@geoffthorpe.net>]

  *) Make the worker MPM shutdown and restart cleanly.  This also
     cleans up some race conditions, and gets the worker using
     pools more cleanly.  [Aaron Bannert <aaron@clove.org>]

  *) Implement CRYPTO_set_locking_callback() in terms of apr_lock
     for mod_ssl
     [Madhusudan Mathihalli <madhusudan_mathihalli@hp.com>]

  *) Fix for mod_include. Ryan's patch to check error
     codes put a return in the wrong place. Also, the
     include handler return code wasn't being checked.
     I don't like macros with returns, so I converted
     SPLIT_AND_PASS_PRETAG_BUCKETS into a function.
     [Paul J. Reder <rederpj@raleigh.ibm.com>]

  *) fix segv in mod_mime if no AddTypes are configured
     [John Sterling <sterling@covalent.net>]

  *) Enable ssl client authentication at SSL_accept time
     [Madhusudan Mathihalli <madhusudan_mathihalli@hp.com>]

  *) Fix a segfault in mod_include when the original request has no
     associated filename (e.g., we're filtering the error document for
     a bad URI).  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix a storage leak (a strdup() call) in mod_mime_magic.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) The prefork and OS/2 MPMs are overwriting the pid file when a second copy
     of httpd is started and shuts down due to socket conflict. Moving the
     call to ap_log_pid solves the problem.

  *) Changed the late-1.3 log_config substitution %c to %X, to log the
     status of the closed connection, as it conflicts with the far more
     common, historical ssl logging directive %...{var}c.  [William Rowe]

  *) Added the common error/ tree to the build/install targets 
     (similar to the common icons/ tree) for the multi-language error 
     messages that Lars committed earlier.  [William Rowe]

  *) Added a multi process, multi threaded OS/2 MPM mpmt_os2.  [Brian Havard]

  *) Added a default commented-out mod_ldap and mod_auth_ldap
     configuration to httpd-std.conf and httpd-win.conf
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) Added documentation for mod_ldap and mod_auth_ldap.
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) Enabled negative caching on attribute comparisons in the LDAP cache.
     Fixed a problem where the default cache TTL was set in milliseconds
     not microseconds causing the cache to time out almost immediately.
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) Fixed all the #if APR_HAS_SHARED_MEMORY checks within the LDAP
     module code to follow APR. [Graham Leggett]

  *) Fixed LDAP cleanup on graceful restarts. LDAP connections are now
     cleaned up when the connection pool pool is cleaned up.
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) Fix a minor issue with Jeff Trawick's mod_include
     patch. Without this patch, the code will just allocate
     more bytes in get_combined_directive than are needed.
     [Paul Reder]

  *) Added the LDAP authentication module mod_auth_ldap.
     [Dave Carrigan <dave@rudedog.org>, Graham Leggett]

  *) Added the LDAP cache and connection pooling module mod_ldap.
     [Dave Carrigan <dave@rudedog.org>, Graham Leggett]

  *) Fix --enable-modules=all breakage with mod_auth_db and mod_auth_digest
     by allowing a module to disable itself if its prerequisites are not
     met.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

Changes with Apache 2.0.24

  *) Fix a couple of issues in mod_include when the tag appeared at
     offsets near 8192 in the file being parsed.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix an assertion failure in mod_ssl when the keepalive timeout is  
     reached.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Numerous improvements to the Win32 build system.  Introduced command line
     builds without requiring .mak files for MSVC 6.0 and later versions.
     Improved .dsp file compatibility for both Visual Studio 5.0 and 6.0 users.
     [William Rowe]

  *) Assorted corrections and improvements to the winnt_mpm startup code.  Better
     reporting of uninstalled services and other error conditions, and changed the 
     default service name to Apache2.  [William Rowe]

  *) Numerous improvements to the Win32 ApacheMonitor utility, including winnt_mpm 
     compatibility with existing Apache 1.3 Win32 Apache management utilites.  
     [Mladen Turk <mturk@mappingsoft.com>, William Rowe]

  *) Fixed the segfaults in mod_mime introduced by hash tables in 2.0.20.
     [William Rowe, Greg Ames]

  *) Rounded out the mod_mime Add/Remove pairs by adding RemoveLanguage
     and RemoveCharset directives.  [William Rowe]

  *) The Unix MPMs other than perchild now allow child server 
     processes to use the accept mutex when starting as root and 
     using SysV sems for the accept mutex.  Previously, this 
     combination would lead to fatal errors in the child server 
     processes.  perchild can't use SysV sems because of security
     issues.  [Jeff Trawick, Greg Ames]

  *) Added Win32 revision stamp resources to all http binaries
     (including modules/ and support/ tools.)  PR7322  [William Rowe]

  *) Fix ap_rvprintf to support more than 4K of data at one time.
     [Cody Sherr <csherr@covalent.net>]

  *) We have always used the obsolete/deprecated Netscape syntax
     for our tracking cookies; now the CookieStyle directive
     allows the Webmaster to choose the Netscape, RFC2109, or
     RFC2965 format.  The new CookieDomain directive allows the
     setting of the cookie's Domain= attribute, too.  PR #s 5006,
     5023, 5920, 6140 [Ken Coar]

  *) Tweak server/Makefile so that the rules for generating exports.c
     are compatible with make utilities which don't expand wildcards
     in a dependency list (e.g., OS/390 make, certain levels of GNU
     make).  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Install the SSL headers.  [John Sterling <sterling@covalent.net>]

  *) Begin to sanitize the MPM configuration directives.  Now, all
     MPMs use the same functions for all common MPM directives.  This
     should make it easier to catch all bugs in these directives once.
     [Cody Sherr <csherr@covalent.net>]

  *) Close a major resource leak.  Every time we had issued a
     graceful restart, we leaked a socket descriptor.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Fix a problem with the new method code.  We need to cast
     the 1 to an apr_int64_t or it will be treated as a 32-bit
     integer, and it will wrap after being shifted 32 times.
     [Cody Sherr <csherr@covalent.net> and Ryan Morgan <rmorgan@covalent.net>]

  *) Fix a bug in mod_expires.  Previous to this patch, if you
     told mod_expires to add 604800 seconds to the last-modified
     time, it actually added 604800 usec's to the last-modified time,
     so that when looking at the response it looked like nothing
     had been done.  The root of the problem was that we always compute
     time in usec's, but we ask users to input sec's.  This means we
     need to convert to usec's before using those values.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) The worker MPM now handles shutdown and restart requests.  It
     definitely isn't perfect, but we do stop the servers correctly.
     The biggest problem right now is that SIGHUP causes the server to
     just die.  [Ryan Bloom]

Changes with Apache 2.0.23

  *) Use the prefork MPM by default on Unix.  [various]

  *) Added a systray icon monitor application for Win32.
     [Mladen Turk <mturk@mappingsoft.com>]

  *) mod_rewrite: Fix the line ending on some non-Unix systems for 
     messages written to the rewrite log.  
     [Richard Labennett <rlabenn@us.ibm.com>]

  *) All mod_autoindex query parsing is now quietly quashed with the 
     IndexOption IgnoreClient.  The IndexOption SuppressColumnSorting 
     still drops the column sort <a href>'s for the column headers, but 
     IgnoreClient is required to ignore these Query options entirely.  
     [William Rowe]

  *) Introduced new mod_autoindex query argument parsing for F=[0|1|2]
     to allow the client to select plain, FancyIndexing or HTMLTable
     formatting, V=[0|1] to inhibit or enable version sorting, and 
     P=pattern to return only specific files.  The old Query Arguments
     were reorganized as C=f for sorting column 'f' (same N, D, S, or M
     as before), and O=A|D for ordering ascending or descending.  
     [William Rowe]

  *) Fixed an error in mod_include's directive parsing routines which
     caused #if, #elif, and #else expressions containing backslashes
     to be improperly evaluated.  [Cliff Woolley]

  *) Introduced new mod_autoindex IndexOptions flags: SuppressIcon to 
     drop the icon column, SuppressRules to drop the <hr> elements, 
     and HTMLTable to create rudimentary HTML table listings (implies 
     FancyIndexing).  [William Rowe]

  *) Re-introduced the mod_autoindex IndexOptions flag TrackModified
     from Apache 1.3.15.  This is needed for two reasons, first, given
     multiple machines within a server farm, ETags and Last-Modified 
     stamps won't correspond from machine to machine, and second, many 
     Unixes don't capture changes to the date or time stamp of existing 
     files, since these don't modify the dirent itself.  [William Rowe]

  *) Re-introduced the mod_autoindex IndexOptions flag FoldersFirst 
     and DirectoryWidth options from Apache 1.3.10. 
     [William Rowe, Ken Coar]

  *) Eliminated FancyIndexing directive, deprecated early in Apache
     1.3 by the IndexOptions FancyIndexing syntax.  [William Rowe]

  *) mod_autoindex now excludes any file names that would result in
     an error, other than a success or redirect.  Also optimized
     the parent directory, always included except in the URI '/'.
     [William Rowe]

  *) Refactored mod_negotiation and mod_mime to help mod_dir accept
     negotiated index pages, and prevent the server from defaulting
     to an autoindex of the directory.  mod_negotiation will now die
     with a 500 Internal Error if it could match some filenames 
     (e.g. for mod_dir) but none can be served.  mod_negotation now
     refuses to serve any file with an extention that mod_mime doesn't
     recognize, and wasn't part of the request.  [William Rowe]

  *) Eliminate mod_cgi's handling of .exe files without the .exe file
     extension.  This is already handled by multiviews, if the admin
     wishes to AddHandler .exe or define a content type handler and 
     associate .exe files with that content type.  Multiviews must be
     enabled to allow these to be served.  [William Rowe]

  *) Speed up the server's response to a spike in incoming workload
     or restarts by assigning empty scoreboard slots to new processes
     when they are available.  [Greg Ames]

  *) Add a handler to mod_includes.c.  This handler is designed to
     implement the XbitHack directive.  This can't be done with a
     fixup, because we need to check the content-type, which is
     only available in the handler phase.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Make the includes filter check return codes from filters lower in
     the filter chain.  If a lower level filter returns an error, then
     the request needs to stop immediately.  This allows mod_include to
     stop parsing data once a lower filter recognizes an error.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Add the ability to extend the methods that Apache understands
     and have those methods <limit>able in the httpd.conf. It uses 
     the same bit mask/shifted offset as the original HTTP methods 
     such as M_GET or M_POST, but expands the total bits from an int to 
     an ap_int64_t to handle more bits for new request methods than 
     an int provides.  [Cody Sherr <csherr@covalent.net>]

  *) Fix broken mod_mime behavior in merging its arguments.  Possible
     cause of unexplicable crashes introduced in 2.0.20.  [William Rowe]

  *) Solve many mod_ssl porting issues (too many to detail) with 
     help from the whole team, but most notably [Ralf S. Engelschall, 
     Madhusudan Mathihalli <madhusudan_mathihalli@hp.com>, 
     Doug MacEachern, William Rowe, Cliff Woolley]

  *) More stall fixes for the threaded & worker mpm's.
     Make mod_status output more accurate.  Don't
     count workers in processes which aren't actively
     serving requests. [Greg Ames]
     
  *) Win32: Get SSI exec cgi tag working. [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Add a single listener/multiple worker MPM.  This MPM is
     definately not fully correct, but it allows us to solve many
     of the problems that exist in the threaded MPM.  This is a 
     modified version of the threaded MPM.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Improve content generation throughout Apache, providing closer
     compliance with HTML 3.2, HTML 4.01 Transitional and XHTML 1.0
     Transitional specifications.  [William Rowe]

Changes with Apache 2.0.22
  
  *) Fix a problem where the threaded MPM stalls after restarts or
     segfaults.  Also prevent multiple active processes from using
     the same scoreboard slot.  [Greg Ames]

  *) Apache/Win32 now fills in the service description with Apache's
     server version string, including loaded and advertised modules.
     [William Rowe]

  *) Improved support for the Win32 build, to recover gracefully from
     missing apr or apr-util directories or the awk interpreter, 
     create the proper cgi-bin examples, including a test-cgi.bat, and 
     fix the perl shebang line for printenv.pl, when installing from 
     the build environment.  [William Rowe]

  *) Fix a segfault in threaded.c caused by passing uninitialized
     apr_thread_t * to apr_thread_join().  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Use new APR number conversion functions to reduce CPU consumption 
     when setting the content length, and in mod_log_config.
     [Brian Pane]
     
  *) Fix problem reported by Taketo Kabe <kabe@sra-tohoku.co.jp>
     where HEAD response headers were being repeated twice for
     files greater than 32K bytes (4*AP_MIN_BYTES_TO_WRITE). This
     problem in the http_header filter was exposed by the recent rewrite
     of the content_length filter. [Taketo Kabe, Bill Stoddard]

  *) Fix seg faults in mod_status with ExtendedStatus enabled, after
     restarts.  A garbage pointer to a vhost's server_rec from the
     previous generation was being left around under certain
     conditions. [Greg Ames]

  *) Fix a cosmetic problem with mod_include.  Non-existant SSI vars
     used to appear as '(none', without the closing paren.
     [Günter Knauf <eflash@gmx.net>]

  *) Improve the exports generating awk script.  In the past, we had
     work around problems in the awk script by avoiding some #if and
     #ifdefs.  This has bitten us many times in generating the exports.c
     file.  This improvement allows corrects the header file parsing.
     [Sander Striker <striker@apache.org>]

Changes with Apache 2.0.21

  *) Resolve the Win32 htpasswd bug, where a file that existed would be
     overwritten, regardless of the -c flag.
     [William Rowe, Mladen Turk <mladen.turk@mail.inet.hr>]

  *) Introduce connection sub-pools into ab.  Truncating the lifetime
     of these allocations means that ab no longer perpetually grows
     its working set, running out of memory on large request attempts.
     [William Rowe]

  *) Make scoreboard creation a hook.  This allows management
     modules to have access to the scoreboard at the time that it is
     created, and at every restart request.  
     [Cody Sherr <csherr@covalent.net>]

  *) Changed AP_MPMQ_MAX_DAEMONS to refer to MaxClients and
     added an AP_MPMQ_MAX_DAEMON_USED to refer to the highest
     daemon index actually used in the scoreboard. I also
     updated the pertinent calls. [Paul J. Reder]

  *) Win32: Prevent listening sockets from being inherited by
     the Apache child process, CGI scripts, rotatelog process
     etc.  If the Apache child process segfaults, any processes 
     that the child started are not reaped. Prior to this fix,
     these processes inherited the listening sockets which sometimes
     prevented the restarted Apache child process from accepting
     connections (ie, the server would hang). 
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Provide vhost and request strings when ExtendedStatus is on.
     [Greg Ames]

  *) Fix some issues with the pod and prefork: check the pod *after*
     processing a connection so that a server processing a time-
     consuming request bails out as soon as practical; when the
     parent process wakes up a server process via connect(), use an
     APR timeout on the connect() so that we don't hang for a long
     time if there aren't server processes around to do accept().
     [Jeff Trawick, Greg Ames]

  *) Performance improvement to mod_mime.c. find_ct() in mod_mime, 
     spends a lot of time in apr_table_get calls.  Using the default 
     httpd.conf, the tables for languages and charsets are somewhat
     large, so the time spent scanning them on each request is
     significant. Replacing the tables with hash tables provides
     a nice speedup. [Brian Pane <bpane@pacbell.net>]

  *) Add two functions to allow modules to access random parts of the
     scoreboard.  This allows modules compiled for one MPM to access the
     scoreboard, even if it the server was compiled for another MPM.
     [Harrie Hazewinkel <harrie@covalent.net>]

Changes with Apache 2.0.20

  *) Fix problem in content-length filter where the filter would
     buffer all the output from a CGI before sending any bytes
     down the filter stack to the network. This problem would cause
     significant memory consumption if the CGIs generated
     lots of bytes. [Bill Stoddard]
  
  *) Get non-blocking CGI pipe reads working with the bucket brigades.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Fix seg fault on Windows when serving files cached with mod_file_cache.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Fix a bug in the threaded MPM that would cause it to kill off all
     workers immediately after starting if the number of workers started
     was above a certain threshold.  [Ryan Bloom, Bill Stoddard]

Changes with Apache 2.0.19

  *) Fix problem with threaded MPM.  The problem was that if each child
     process was busy serving a single long-lived request and the server
     was sent a graceful restart signal, the server would stop serving
     requests.  This would happen because each child process would wait to
     die until the last thread was done, and the parent wouldn't spawn any
     new children until a process died.  Now, the parent looks at the fact
     that the children are dying gracefully, and starts new children.
     Those new children only start enough threads to compliment the number
     of threads in the other child process that shares the same spot in
     the scoreboard.  In this way, we make sure to never go over
     MaxClients.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) modified mod_negotiation and mod_autoindex to speed up by almost a
     factor of two on apr_dir_read()-enhanced platforms, such as Win32
     and OS2, by calling ap_sub_request_lookup_dirent() with the results
     already provided by apr_dir_read().  [William Rowe]

  *) mod_file_cache is now more robust to filtering and serves requests
     slightly more efficiently.  [Cliff Woolley]

  *) Fix problem handling FLUSH bucket in the chunked encoding filter.
     Module was calling ap_rwrite() followed by ap_rflush() but the 
     served content was not being displayed in the browser. Inspection
     of the output stream revealed that the first data chunk was
     missing the trailing CRLF required by the RFC.  [Bill Stoddard]

  *) apxs no longer generates ap_send_http_header() in the example handler

  *) Fix an ab problem which could cause a divide-by-zero exception
     with certain invocations (e.g., ab -k -c 6 -n 100 localhost/).
     [Ian Holsman <ianh@cnet.com>]

  *) Solve case-insensitive platforms' confusion about negotiated
     filenames, allowing files of differnt case to match in choosing
     the document to serve.  [William Rowe]

  *) Fix brokenness when ThreadsPerChild is higher than the built-in
     limit.  We left ap_threads_per_child at the higher value which
     led to segfaults when doing certain scoreboard operations.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix seg faults and/or missing output from mod_include.  The
     default_handler was using the subrequest pool for files and
     MMAPs, even though the associated APR structures typically 
     live longer than the subrequest. [Greg Ames]
  
  *) Extend mod_setenvif to support specifying regular expressions
     on the SetEnvIf (and SetEnvIfNoCase) directive attribute field.
     Example:  SetEnvIf ^TS*  [a-z].* HAVE_TS 
     will cause HAVE_TS to be set if any of the request headers begins 
     with "TS" and has a value that begins with any character in the
     set [a-z]. [Bill Stoddard]

  *) httpd children now re-bind themselves to a random CPU on
     multiprocessor systems on AIX via bindprocessor() in 2.0.
     [Victor J. Orlikowski]

  *) Fix htdigest. It would go into a loop in getline when adding 
     a second user. [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Win32 platforms now fully support mod_userdir options.  [Will Rowe]

  *) Automatically generate httpd.exp for AIX.
     DSOs now work again on AIX in 2.0
     [Victor J. Orlikowski]

  *) Add a new request hook, error_log.  This phase allows modules
     to act on the error log string _after_ it has been written
     to the error log.  The goal for this hook is to allow monitoring
     modules to send the error string to the monitoring agent.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Modify mod_echo to make it use filters for input and output.
     [Ryan Morgan <rmorgan@covalent.net>]

  *) Extend mod_headers to support conditional driven Header 
     add, append and set. Use SetEnvIf to set an envar and conditionally
     add/append/set headers based on this envar thusly:

     SetEnvIf TSMyHeader value HAVE_TSMyHeader
     Header add MyHeader "%t %D" env=HAVE_TSMyHeader

     If the request contains header "TSMyHeader: value" then header
     MyHeader: "t=xxxxxxxxxx D=yyyy" will be sent on the response.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Extend mod_headers to support using format specifiers on Header
     add, append and set header values. Two format specifiers are supported:

     %t - reports, in UTC microseconds since the epoch, when the
          request was received.

     %D - reports the time, in microseconds, between when the request was 
          received and the response sent. 

     Examples:
     Header add MyHeader "This request served in %D microseconds. %t"

     results in a header being added to the response that looks like this:
     
     MyHeader: This request served in D=5438 microseconds. t=991424704447256

     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Fix reset_filter().  We need to be careful how we remove filters.
     If we set r->output_filters to NULL, we also have to reset the
     connection's filters.  [John Sterling]

  *) Optimise reset_filter() in http_protocol.c. [Greg Stein]

  *) Add a check to ap_die() to make sure the filter stack is sane and
     contains the correct basic filters when an error occurs. This fixes
     a problem where headers are not being sent on error. [John Sterling]

  *) New Header directive 'echo' option. "Header echo regex" will
     cause any headers received on the request that match regex to be
     echoed to (included in) the response headers.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) include/ap_compat.h tested and set APR_COMPAT_H instead of AP_COMPAT_H.
     This prevented the inclusion of apr_compat.h.  PR #7773
     [Oleg Broytmann <phd@phd.pp.ru>]

  *) Moved util_uri to the apr-util library.  This required a bunch of
     apr_name changes for the uri utility functions.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Move the addition of default AP_HTTP_HTTP_HEADER filters to the
     insert_filter phase so that other filters are not bypassed by default.
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) Reimplement mod_headers as an output filter. mod_headers can now
     add custom headers to inbound requests using the RequestHeader directive
     and to responses using the same old Header directive.  [Graham Leggett]

Changes with Apache 2.0.18

  *) Fix command-line processing so that if a bad argument is specified
     Apache will exit.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Change the make targets and rules to be consistent in all of the
     Apache-owned source trees.  [Roy Fielding]
     
  *) Fix processing of the TRACE method.  Previously we passed bogus
     parms to form_header_field() and it overlaid some vhost structures,
     resulting in a segfault in check_hostalias(). 
     [Greg Ames, Jeff Trawick]

  *) Win32: Add support for reliable piped logs. If the logging process
     goes down, Apache will automatically restart it. This function has 
     been part of Apache on Unix/Linux/BSD since the early v1.3 releases.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Do not start piped log processes during the config file 
     preflight.  This change also circumvents a problem on 
     Windows where the rotatelog processes created during preflight
     was not getting cleaned up properly.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) add "Request Phase Participation" info to mod_info
     [Doug MacEachern]

  *) Make first phase changes to the scoreboard data structures in
     preparation for the rewriting of the scoreboard per my posted
     design notes. [Paul J. Reder]

  *) Fix httpd's definition of LTFLAGS to be consistent with that of apr
     and apr-util, allow it to be overridden by the configure command-line
     (default="--silent") and introduce LT_LDFLAGS to replace what we were
     formerly abusing as LTFLAGS.  [Roy Fielding]

  *) Clean up the reporting of incorrect closing container tags.
     [Barrie Slaymaker <barries@slaysys.com>]

  *) Simplify the configure process by moving all libtool stuff to APR
     and moving hints.m4 inline.  [Roy Fielding]

  *) Add the AP_DECLARE()/AP_CORE_DECLARE macros on the return types
     of functions used by mod_proxy for export in the DLL 
     [Ian Holsman <IanH@cnet.com>]

  *) Prevent a hang when a cgi handled by mod_cgid tries to read a
     request body from its stdin but no reqest body is being written to 
     the cgi.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) mod_log_config: %c connection status incorrectly logged
     as "-" (non-keepalive) when MaxKeepAliveRequests is set to 0.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Get mod_cern_meta working under Windows
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Create Files, and thus MMAPs, out of the request pool, not the
     connection pool.  This solves a small resource leak that had us
     not closing files until a connection was closed.  In order to do
     this, at the end of the core_output_filter, we loop through the
     brigade and convert any data we have into a single HEAP bucket
     that we know will survive clearing the request_rec.
     [Ryan Bloom, Justin Erenkrantz <jerenkrantz@ebuilt.com>,
      Cliff Woolley]

  *) Completely revamp configure so that it preserves the standard make
     variables CPPFLAGS, CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, LDFLAGS and LIBS by moving
     the configure additions to EXTRA_* variables.  Also, allow the user
     to specify NOTEST_* values for all of the above, which eliminates the
     need for THREAD_CPPFLAGS, THREAD_CFLAGS, and OPTIM.  Fix the setting
     of INCLUDES and EXTRA_INCLUDES.  Check flags as they are added to
     avoid pointless duplications.  Fix the order in which flags are given
     on the compile and link lines.  Remove obsolete macros APR_DOEXTRA,
     AC_ADD_LIBRARY, AC_CHECK_DEFINE, APACHE_PASSTHRU, and APACHE_ONCE.
     Added APR_SAVE_THE_ENVIRONMENT and APR_RESTORE_THE_ENVIRONMENT macros.
     Renamed AC_TYPE_RLIM_T macro to APACHE_TYPE_RLIM_T.  [Roy Fielding]

  *) Get mod_tls to compile/work better on Windows.  PR #7612
     [Bernhard Schrenk <b.schrenk@improx.com>]

  *) Fix shutdown/restart hangs in the threaded MPM.
     [Jeff Trawick, Greg Ames, Ryan Bloom]
  
  *) Removed the keptalive boolean from conn_rec because it is now only
     used by a single routine and can be replaced by a local variable.
     [Greg Stein, Ryan Bloom, Roy Fielding]

  *) Patch prefork to put enough of the signal processing back in so that
     signals are all handled properly now. The previous patch fixed the
     deadlock race condition, but broke the user directed signal handling.
     This fixes it to work the way it did before my previous prefork patch
     (primarily, SIGTERM is now working).
 
  *) Change how input filters decide how much data is returned to the
     higher filter.  We used to use a field in the conn_rec, with this
     change, we use an argument to ap_get_brigade to determine how much
     data is retrieved. [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Fix seg fault at start-up introduced by Ryan's change to enable
     modules to specify their own logging tags. mod_log_config
     registers an optional function, ap_register_log_handler().
     ap_register_log_handler() was being called by http_core before
     the directive hash table was created. This patch creates the
     directive hash table before ap_register_log_handler() is
     registered as an optional function.
     [jean-frederic clere <jfrederic.clere@fujitsu-siemens.com>]

  *) Add ap_set_int_slot() function
     [John K. Sterling <sterling@covalent.net>]

  *) Under certain circumstances, Apache did not supply the
     right response headers when requiring authentication.
     [Gertjan van Wingerde <Gertjan.van.Wingerde@cmg.nl>] PR#7114
     (This is a port of the change that went into Apache 1.3.19.)

  *) Allow modules to specify their own logging tags.  This basically
     allows a module to tell mod_log_config that when %x is encountered
     a specific function should be called.  Currently, x can be any single
     character.  It may be more useful to make this a string at some point.
     [Ryan Bloom]

Changes with Apache 2.0.17

  *) If a higher-level filter handles the the byterange aspects of a
     request, then the byterange filter should not try to redo the
     work.  The most common case of this happening, is a byterange
     request going through the proxy, and the origin server handles
     the byterange request.  The proxy should ignore it.
     [Graham Leggett <minfrin@sharp.fm>]

  *) Changed the threaded mpm to have child_main join to each of the
     worker threads to make sure the kids are all gone before child_main
     exits after a signal (cleanup from perform_idle_server_maintenance).
     This is an extension of Ryans recent commit to make the child_main
     the signal thread.

  *) Add more options to the ap_mpm_query function.  This also allows MPMs to
     report if their threads are dynamic or static.  Finally, this also
     implements a new API, ap_show_mpm, which returns the MPM that was
     required into the core. [Harrie Hazewinkel <harrie@covalent.net>]

  *) Do not install the binaries from the support directory twice.
     [jun-ichiro hagino <itojun@iijlab.net>]

  *) The ap_f* functions should flush data to the filter that is passed
     in, not the the filter after the one passed in.
     [Ryan Morgan <rmorgan@covalent.net>]

  *) Make ab work again by changing its native types to apr types and formats.
     [Justin Erenkrantz <jerenkrantz@ebuilt.com>]

  *) Move the byterange filter and all of the supporting functions back
     to the HTTP module.  The byterange filter turned out to be very
     HTTP specific, and it belongs in the HTTP module.  [Greg Stein]

  *) Make clean, distclean, and extraclean consistently according to the
     Gnu makefile guidelines.  [Justin Erenkrantz <jerenkrantz@ebuilt.com>]

  *) Fix errors in the renaming of the apr_threadattr_detach_xxx functions.
     This may have been causing problems stopping processes in the threaded
     mpm's. [Greg Ames]

  *) Fix content-length in mod_negotiation to a long int representation.
     [William Rowe]

  *) Remove BindAddress from the default config file.
     [giles@nemeton.com.au]

  *) Allow module authors to add a module to their Apache build using
     --with-module, without re-running buildconf.  The syntax is:
	--with-module=module_type:/path/to/module.c
     The configure script will copy the module.c file to 
     modules/module_type, and it will be added to the relevant Makefiles.
     currently, this only works for static modules.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Changes required to make prefork clean up idle children properly.
     There was a window during which a starting worker deadlocks when
     an idle cleanup arrives before it completes init. Apache then keeps
     trying to cleanup the same deadlocked worker forever (until higher
     pids come along, but it still will never reduce below the deadlocked
     pid). Thus the number of children would not reduce to the correct
     idle level. [Paul J. Reder]

Changes with Apache 2.0.16

  *) Change the default installation directory to /usr/local/apache2,
     as now defined by the "Apache" layout in config.layout. [Marc Slemko]

  *) OS/2: Added support for building loadable modules as OS/2 DLLs. 
     [Brian Havard]

  *) Get MaxRequestsPerChild working with the Windows MPM.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Make generic hooks to work, with mod_generic_hook_import/export
     experimental modules.  [Ben Laurie, Will Rowe]

  *) Fix segfaults for configuration file syntax errors such as
     "<Directory>" followed by "</Directory" and
     "<Directory>" followed by "</Directoryz>".  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Cleanup the --enable-layout option of configure.  This makes
     us use a consistent location for the config.layout file, and it
     makes configure more portable.
     [jun-ichiro hagino <itojun@iijlab.net>]

  *) Changes to 'ab'; fixed int overrun's, added statistics, output in
     csv/gnuplot format, rudimentary ssl support and various other tweaks
     to make results more true to what is measured. The upshot of this it
     turns out that 'ab' has often underreported the true performance of
     apache. Often by a order of magnitude :-) See talk/paper of Sander 
     Temme at April ApacheCon 2001 for details.
     [Dirk-Willem van Gulik]

  *) Clean up mod_cgid's temporary request pool.  Besides fixing a
     storage leak this ensures that some unnecessary pipes are closed.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Performance: Add quick_handler hook. This hook is called at the
     very beginning of the request processing before location_walk,
     translate_name, etc.  This hook is useful for URI keyed content
     caches like Mike Abbott's Quick Shortcut Cache.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) top_module global variable renamed to ap_top_module [Perl]

  *) Move ap_set_last_modified to the core.  This is a potentially 
     controversial change, because this is kind of HTTP specific.  However
     many protocols should be able to take advantage of this kind of
     information.  I expect that headers will need one more layer of
     indirection for multi-protocol work, but this is a small step in
     the right direction.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Enable mod_status by default.  This matches what Apache 1.3 does.
     [Ed Korthof]

  *) Add a ScriptSock directive to the default config file.  This is
     only enabled when mod_cgid is used.  
     [Taketo Kabe <kabe@sra-tohoku.co.jp>]

Changes with Apache 2.0.15

  *) Untangled the buildconf script and eliminated the need for build's
     aclocal.m4, generated_lists, build.mk, build2.mk, and a host of other
     libtool muck that is now under srclib/apr/build.  [Roy Fielding]

  *) Win32: Don't accept more connections than we have worker threads
     to handle.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Fix bug in the Unix threaded.c MPM that allowed child processes
     to fork() new child processes. 
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) SECURITY: Fix a major security problem with double-reverse lookup 
     checking.  Previously, a client connecting over IPv4 would not be 
     matched properly when the server had an IPv6 listening socket.  
     PR #7407   [Taketo Kabe <kiabe@sra-tohoku.co.jp>]

  *) Change the way the beos MPM handles polling to allow it to stop and
     restart.  Problem was the sockets being polled were being reset by
     the select call, so once it had accepted a connection it was no
     longer listening on the UDP socket we use for shutdown instructions.
     APR needs to be altered, patch on it's way. [David Reid]

  *) Empty out the brigade shared by ap_getline()/ap_get_client_block()
     on error exit from ap_getline().  Some other code got upset because
     the wrong data was in the brigade.  [Greg Ames, Jeff Trawick]

  *) Handle ap_discard_request_body() being called more than once.
     [Greg Ames, Jeff Trawick]

  *) Get rid of an inadvertent close of file descriptor 2 in
     mod_mime_magic.  [Greg Ames, Jeff Trawick]

  *) Add a hook, create_request.  This hook allows modules to modify
     a request while it is being created.  This hook is called for all
     request_rec's, main request, sub request, and internal redirect.
     When this hook is called, the the r->main, r->prev, r->next
     pointers have been set, so modules can determine what kind of
     request this is.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Cleanup the build process a bit more.  The Apache configure
     script no longer creates its own helper scripts, it just
     uses APR's.  
     [jean-frederic clere <jfrederic.clere@fujitsu-siemens.com>]

  *) Stop the forced downgrade of the connection to HTTP/1.0 for
     proxy requests.  [Graham Leggett]

  *) Avoid using sscanf to determine the HTTP protocol number in
     the common case because sscanf is a performance hog. From
     Mike Abbot's Accelerating Apache patch number 6.
     [Mike Abbot <mja@trudge.engr.sgi.com>, Bill Stoddard]

  *) SECURITY: Fix a security exposure in mod_access.  Previously when 
     IPv6 listening sockets were used, allow/deny-from-IPv4-address rules 
     were not evaluated properly (PR #7407).  Also, add the ability to 
     specify IPv6 address strings with optional prefix length on Allow 
     and Deny.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Enhance rotatelogs so that a UTC offset can be specified, and
     the logfile name can be formatted using strftime(3).  (Brought
     forward from 1.3.)  [Ken Coar]

  *) Reimplement the Windows MPM (mpm_winnt.c) to eliminate calling 
     DuplicateHandle on an IOCompletionPort (a practice which
     MS "discourages"). The new model does not rely on associating
     the completion port with the listening sockets, thus the
     completion port can be completely managed within the child 
     process.  A dedicated thread accepts connections off the network,
     then calls PostQueuedCompletionStatus() to wake up worker
     threads blocked on the completion port.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Bring forward the --suexec-umask option which allows the
     builder to preset the umask for suexec processes.  [Ken Coar]

  *) Add a -V flag to suexec, which causes it to display the
     compile-time settings with which it was built.  (Only
     usable by root or the AP_HTTPD_USER username.)  [Ken Coar]

  *) Mod_include should always unset the content-length if the file is
     going to be passed through send_parsed_content.  There is no to
     determine if the content will change before actually scanning the
     entire content.  It is far safer to just remove the C-L as long
     as we are scanning it.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Make sure Apache sends WWW-Authenticate during a reverse proxy
     request and not Proxy-Authenticate.
     [Graham Leggett <minfrin@sharp.fm>]

Changes with Apache 2.0.14

  *) Fix content-length computation.  We ONLY compute a content-length if
     We are not in a 1.1 request and we cannot chunk, and this is a keepalive
     or we already have all the data.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Report unbounded containers in the config file.  Previously, a typo
     in the </container> directive could result in the rest of the config
     file being silently ignored, with undesired defaults used.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Make the old_write filter use the ap_f* functions for the buffering.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Move more code from the http module into the core server.  This
     is core code, basically the default handler, the default input
     and output filters, and all of the core configuration directives.
     All of this code is required in order for the server to work, with or
     without HTTP.  The server is closer to working without the HTTP
     module, although there is still more to do.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Fix a number of SGI compile warnings throughout the server.  Fix some
     bad parameters to apr_bucket_read().  Fix a bad statement in 
     ap_method_in_list().  For the mod_rewrite cache use apr_time_t 
     consistently; we were mixing apr_time_t and time_t in invalid ways 
     before.  In load_file(), call apr_dso_error() instead of 
     apr_strerror() so that we get a more specific string on some platforms.
     PR #6980  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Allow modules to query the MPM about it's execution profile.  This
     query API can and should be extended in the future, but for now,
     max_daemons, and threading or forking is a very good start.
     [Jon Travis <jtravis@covalent.net>]

  *) Modify mod_include to send blocks of data no larger than 9k.
     Without this, mod_include will wait until the whole file is parsed,
     or the first tag is found to send any data to the client.
     [Paul J. Reder <rederpj@raleigh.ibm.com>]

  *) Fix mod_info, so that <Directory> and <Location> directives are
     not displayed twice when displaying the current configuration.
     [Ryan Morgan <rmorgan@covalent.net>]

  *) Add config directives to override DEFAULT_ERROR_MSG and
     DEFAULT_TIME_FORMAT.  This was sent in as PR 6193.
     [Dan Rench <drench@xnet.com>]

  *) Get mod_info building and loading on Win32.  [William Rowe]

  *) Begin to move protocol independant functions out of mod_http.  The goal
     is to have only functions that are HTTP specific in the http directory.
     [Ryan Bloom]

Changes with Apache 2.0.13

  *) Don't assume that there will always be multiple calls to the byterange 
     filter.  It is possible that we will need to do byteranges with only
     one call to the filter.  [Ryan Morgan <rmorgan@covalent.net>]

  *) Move the error_bucket definition from the http module to the
     core server.  Every protocol will need this ability, not just
     HTTP.  [Ryan Bloom]

Changes with Apache 2.0.12

  *) Modify mod_file_cache to save pre-formatted strings for 
     content-length and last-modified headers for performance. 
     [Mike Abbot <mja@trudge.engr.sgi.com>]

  *) Namespace protect IOBUFSIZ since it is exposed in the API.
     [Jon Travis <jtravis@covalent.net>]

  *) Use "Basic" authentication instead of "basic" in ab, as the spec
     says we should.  [Andre Breiler <andre.breiler@rd.bbc.co.uk>]

  *) Fix a seg fault in mod_userdir.c.  We used to use the pw structure
     without ever filling it out.  This fixes PR 7271.
     [Taketo Kabe <kabe@sra-tohoku.co.jp> and 
      Cliff Woolley <cliffwoolley@yahoo.com>]

  *) Add a couple of GCC attribute tags to printf style functions.
     [Jon Travis <jtravis@covalent.net>]

  *) Add the correct language tag for interoperation with the Taiwanese
     versions of MSIE and Netscape. [Clive Lin <clive@CirX.ORG>] PR#7142

  *) Migrate the perchild MPM to use the new apr signal child, and 
     APR thread functions.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Close one copy of the CGI's stdout before creating the new process.
     The CGI will still have stdout, because we have already dup'ed it.
     This keeps Apache from waiting forever to send the results of a CGI
     process that has forked a long-lived child process.
     [Taketo Kabe <kabe@sra-tohoku.co.jp>]

  *) Remove the rest of the pthreads functions from the threaded MPM.
     This requires the APR support for a signal thread that was just
     added.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Make mod_dir use a fixup for sending a redirect to the browser.
     Before this, we were using a handler, which doesn't make much
     sense, because the handler wasn't generating any data, it would
     either return a redirect error code, or DECLINED.  This fits the
     current hooks better.  [Ryan Morgan <rmorgan@covalent.net>]

  *) Make the threaded MPM use APR threads instead of pthreads.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Get mod_tls to the point where it actually appears to work in all cases.
     [Ben Laurie]

  *) implement --enable-modules and --enable-mods-shared for "all" and
     "most".  [Greg Stein]

  *) Move the threaded MPM to use APR locks instead of pthread locks.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Rename mpmt_pthread to threaded.  This is more in line with the
     fact that mpmt_pthread shouldn't be using pthreads directly, and
     it is a smaller name that doesn't tie into anything.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Rename the module structures so that the exported symbol matches
     the file name, and it is easier to automate the installation
     process (generating LoadModule directives from the module filenames).
     [Martin Kraemer]

  *) Remove the coalesce filter.  With the ap_f* functions, this filter
     is no longer needed. [Ryan Bloom]

Changes with Apache 2.0.11

  *) Remove the dexter MPM.  Perchild is the same basic idea, but it has the
     added feature of allowing a uid/gid per child process.  If no
     uid/gid is specified, then Perchild behaves exactly like dexter.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Get perchild building again. [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Don't disable threads just because we are using the prefork MPM.
     If somebody wants to compile without threads, they must now add
     --disable-threads to the configure command line.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Begin to move the calls to update_child_status into common code, so
     that each individual MPM does not need to update the scoreboard itself.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Allow mod_tls to compile under Unix boxes where openssl has been
     installed to the system include files.
     [Gomez Henri <new-httpd@slib.fr>]

  *) Cleanup the mod_tls configure process.  This should remove any need
     to hand-edit any files.  We require OpenSSL 0.9.6 or later, but 
     configure doesn't check that yet.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Add a very early prototype of SSL support (in mod_tls.c). It is
     vital that you read modules/tls/README before attempting to build
     it. [Ben Laurie]

  *) Fix a potential seg fault on all platforms.  David Reid fixed this
     on BEOS, but the problem could happen anywhere, so we don't want
     to #ifdef it. [Cliff Woolley <cliffwoolley@yahoo.com>]
 
  *) Add new LogFormat directive, %D, to log time it takes to serve a
     request in microseconds. [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Change AddInputFilter and AddOutputFilter to SetInputFilter and
     SetOutputFilter.  This corresponds nicely with the other Set 
     directives, which operate on containers while the Add* directives
     tend to work directly on extensions.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Cleanup the header handling a bit.  This uses the apr_brigade_*
     functions for the buffering so that we don't need to compute
     the length of the headers before we actually create the header
     buffer.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Allow filters to buffer data using the ap_f* functions.  These have
     become macros that resolve directly to apr_brigade_*.  
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Get the Unix MPM's to do a graceful restart again.  If we are going
     to register a cleanup with ap_cleanup_scoreboard, then we have to
     kill the cleanup with the same function,  and that function can't be
     static.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Install all required header files.  Without these, it was not
     possible to compile some modules outside of the server.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Fix the AliasMatch directive in Apache 2.0.  When we brought a patch
     forward from 1.3 to 2.0, we missed a single line, which broke regex
     aliases.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) We have a poor abstraction in the protocol.  This is a temporary
     hack to fix the bug, but it will need to be fixed for real.  If
     we find an error while sending out a custom error response, we back
     up to the first non-OK request and send the data.  Then, when we send
     the EOS from finalize_request_protocol, we go to the last request,
     to ensure that we aren't sending an EOS to a request that has already
     received one.  Because the data is sent on a different request than
     the EOS, the error text never gets sent down the filter stack.  This
     fixes the problem by finding the last request, and sending the data
     with that request.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Make the server status page show the correct restart time, and
     thus the proper uptime. [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Move the CGI creation logic from mod_include to mod_cgi(d).  This
     should reduce the amount of duplicate code that is required to
     create CGI processes.
     [Paul J. Reder <rederpj@raleigh.ibm.com>]

  *) ap_new_connection() closes the socket and returns NULL if a socket
     call fails.  Usually this is due to a connection which has been 
     reset.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Move the Apache version information out of httpd.h and into release.h.
     This is in preparation for the first tag with the new tag and release
     system.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Begin restructuring scoreboard code to enable adding back in
     the ability to use IPC other than shared memory.
     Get mod_status working on Windows again. [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Make mod_status work with 2.0.  This will work for prefork,
     mpmt_pthread, and dexter.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Correct a typo in httpd.conf.
     [Kunihiro Tanaka <tanaka@apache.or.jp>] PR#7154 

  *) Really fix mod_rewrite map lookups this time. [Tony Finch]

  *) Get the correct IP address if ServerName isn't set and we can't
     find a fully-qualified domain name at startup.
     PR#7170 [Danek Duvall <dduvall@eng.sun.com>]

  *) Make mod_cgid work with SuExec.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Adopt apr user/group name features for mod_rewrite.  Eliminates some
     'extra' stat's for user/group since they should never occur, and now
     resolves the SCRIPT_USER and SCRIPT_GROUP, including on WinNT NTFS
     volumes.  [William Rowe]

  *) Adopt apr features to simplify mod_includes.  This changes the
     behavior of the USER_NAME variable, unknown uid's are now reported
     as USER_NAME="<unknown>" rather than the old user#000 result.
     WinNT now resolves USER_NAME on NTFS volumes.  [William Rowe]

  *) Adopt apr features for simplifing mod_userdir, and accept the new
     Win32/OS2 exceptions without hiccuping.  [William Rowe]

  *) Replace configure --with-optim option by using and saving the
     environment variable OPTIM instead.  This is needed because configure
     options do not support multiple flags separated by spaces.
     [Roy Fielding]

  *) Fix some byterange handling.  If we get a byte range that looks like
     "-999999" where that is past the end of the file, we should return 
     a PARTIAL CONTENT status code, and return the whole file as one big
     byterange.  This matches the 1.3 handling now.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Make the error bucket a real meta-data bucket.  This means that the
     bucket length is 0, and a read returns NULL data.  If one of these
     buckets is passed down after the headers are sent, this data will
     just be ignored.  [Greg Stein]

  *) The prefork MPM wasn't killing child processes correctly if a restart
     signal was received while the process was serving a request.  The child
     process would become the equivalent of a second parent process.  If
     we break out of the accept loop, then we need to do die after cleaning
     up after ourselves.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Change the Prefork MPM to use SIGWINCH instead of SIGUSR1 for graceful
     restarts.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Modify the apr_stat/lstat/getfileinfo calls within apache to use
     the most optimal APR_FINFO_wanted bits.  This spares Win32 from
     performing very expensive owner, group and permission lookups
     and allows the server to function until these apr_finfo_t fields
     are implemented under Win32.  [William Rowe]

  *) Support for typedsafe optional functions - that is functions exported by
     optional modules, which, therefore, may or may not be present, depending
     on configuration. See the experimental modules mod_optional_fn_{ex,im}port
     for sample code. [Ben Laurie]

  *) filters can now report an HTTP error to the server.  This is done
     by sending a brigade where the first bucket is an error_bucket.
     This bucket is a simple bucket that stores an HTTP error and
     a string.  Currently the string is not used, but it may be needed
     to output an error log.  The http_header_filter will find this
     bucket, and output the error text, and then return 
     AP_FILTER_ERROR, which informs the server that the error web page
     has already been sent.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) If we get an error, then we should remove all filters except for
     those critical to serving a web page.  This fixes a bug, where
     error pages were going through the byterange filter, even though
     that made no sense.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Relax the syntax checking of Host: headers in order to support
     iDNS. PR#6635 [Tony Finch]

  *) Cleanup the byterange filter to use the apr_brigade_partition
     and apr_bucket_copy functions.  This removes a lot of very messy
     code, and hopefully makes this filter more stable.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Remove AddModule and ClearModuleList directives.  Both of these
     directives were used to ensure that modules could be enabled
     in the correct order.  That requirement is now gone, because
     we use hooks to ensure that modules are in the correct order.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) When SuExec is specified, we need to add it to the list of
     targets to be built.  If we don't, then any changes to the
     configuration won't affect SuExec, unless 'make suexec' is
     specifically run.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Cleaned out open_file from mod_file_cache, as apr now accepts
     the APR_XTHREAD argument to open a file for consumption by
     parallel threads on win32.  [William Rowe]

  *) Correct a bug in determining when we follow symlinks.  The code
     expected a stat -1 result, not an apr_status_t positive error.
     Also check if the APR_FINFO_USER fields are valid before we
     follow the link.  [William Rowe]

  *) Move initgroupgs, ap_uname2id and ap_gname2id from util.c to
     mpm_common.c.  These functions are only valid on some platforms,
     so they should not be in the main-line code. [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Remove ap_chdir_file().  This function is not thread-safe,
     and nobody is currently using it.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Do not try to run make depend if there are no .c files in the
     current directory, doing so makes `make depend` fail.
     [Ryan Bloom]

   *) Update highperformance.conf to work with either prefork or
      pthreads mpms.  [Greg Ames] 

  *) Stop checking to see if this is a pipelined request if we know
     for a fact that it isn't.  Basically, if r->connection->keepalive == 0.
     This keeps us from making an extra read call when serving a 1.0
     request.  [Ryan Bloom and Greg Stein]

  *) Fix the handling of variable expansion look-ahead in mod_rewrite,
     i.e. syntax like %{LA-U:REMOTE_USER}, and also fix the parsing of
     more complicated nested RewriteMap lookups. PR#7087 [Tony Finch]

  *) Fix the RFC number mentioned when complaining about a missing
     Host: header. PR#7079 [Alexey Toptygin <alexeyt@wam.umd.edu>]

  *) Fix an endless loop in ab which occurred when ab was posting
     and the server dropped the connection unexpectedly.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix a segfault while handling request bodies in ap_http_filter().  
     This problem has been seen with mod_dav usage as well as with 
     requests where the body was just being discarded.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Some adjustment on the handling and automatic setting (via
     hints.m4) of various compilation flags (eg: CFLAGS). Also,
     add the capability to specify flags (NOTEST_CFLAGS and
     NOTEST_LDFLAGS) which are used to compile Apache, but
     not used during the configuration process. Useful for
     flags like "-Werror". [Jim Jagielski]

  *) Stop using environment variables to force debug mode or
     no detach.  We now use the -D command line argument to 
     specify the correct mode.  -DONE_PROCESS and -DNO_DETACH.
     [Greg Stein, Ryan Bloom]

  *) Change handlers to use hooks. [Ben Laurie]

  *) Stop returning copies of filenames from both apr_file_t and
     apr_dir_t.  We pstrdup the filenames that we store in the
     actual structures, so we don't need to pstrdup the strings again.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) mod_cgi: Fix some problems where the wrong error value was being
     traced.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) EBCDIC: Fix some missing ASCII conversion on some protocol data.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Add generic hooks. [Ben Laurie]

  *) Use a real pool to dup the error log descriptor.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Fix a segfault caused by mod_ext_filter when the external filter 
     program does not exist. [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix an output truncation error when on an HTTP >= 1.0 request an
     object of size between DEFAULT_BUCKET_SIZE and AP_MIN_BYTES_TO_WRITE 
     was served through mod_charset_lite (or anything else that would
     create a transient bucket in this size range).  ap_bucket_make_heap()
     silently failed (fixed), transient_setaside() discovered it, but
     ap_save_brigade() ignored it (fixed). [Jeff Trawick]
     
  *) Ignore \r\n or \n when using PEEK mode for input filters.  The problem
     is that some browsers send extra lines at the end of POST requests, and
     we don't want to delay sending data back to the user just because the
     browser isn't well behaved. [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Get SuEXEC working again.  We can't send absolute paths to suExec
     because it refuses to execute those programs.  SuEXEC also wasn't
     always recognizing configuration changes made using the autoconf
     setup.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Allow the buildconf process to find the config.m4 files in the correct
     order.  Basically, we can now name config.m4 files as config\d\d.m4,
     and we will sort them correctly when inserting them into the build
     process.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Get mod_cgid to use apr calls for creating the actual CGI process.
     This also allows mod_cgid to use ap_os_create_priviledged_process,
     thus allowing for SuExec execution from mod_cgid.  Currently, we do
     not support everything that standard SuExec supports, but at least
     it works minimally now. [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Allow SuExec to be configured from the ./configure command line.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Update some of the docs in README and INSTALL to reflect some of
     the changes in Apache 2.0 [Cliff Woolley <cliffwoolley@yahoo.com>]

  *) If we get EAGAIN returned from the call to apr_sendfile, then we
     need to call sendfile again.  This gets us serving large files
     such as apache_2.0a9.tar.gz on FreeBSD again. [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Get the support programs building cleanly again.
     [Cliff Woolley <cliffwoolley@yahoo.com>]

  *) The Apache/Win32 Apache.exe and dll's now live in bin.  The 
     current directory logic now backs up over bin/ to determine the
     server root from the Apache.exe path.

  *) Apache/Win32 now follows the standard conventions of mod_foo.so
     loadable modules, dynamic libs are all named libfoo.dll, and the
     makefile.win populates the include, lib and libexec directories.

  *) Apache is now IPv6-capable.  On systems where APR supports IPv6,
     Apache gets IPv6 listening sockets by default.  Additionally, the
     Listen, NameVirtualHost, and <VirtualHost> directives support IPv6
     numeric address strings (e.g., "Listen [fe80::1]:8080").
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Modify the install directory layout.  Modules are now installed in
     modules/.  Shared libraries should be installed in libraries/, but
     we don't have any of those on Unix yet.  All install directories
     are modifyable at configure time. [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Install all header files in the same directory on Unix. [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Get the functions in server/linked into the server, regardless of
     which modules linked into the server.  This uses the same hack 
     for Apache that we use for APR and apr-util to ensure all of the
     necessary functions are linked.  As a part of thise, the CHARSET_EBCDIC
     was renamed to AP_CHARSET_EBCDIC for namespace protection, and to make
     the scripts a bit easier.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Rework the RFC1413 handling to make it thread-safe, use a timeout
     on the query, and remove IPv4 dependencies.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Get all of the auth modules to the point that they will install and
     be loadable into the server.  Our new build/install mechanism expects
     that all modules will have a common name format.  The auth modules 
     didn't use that format, so we didn't install them properly.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) API routines ap_pgethostbyname() and ap_pduphostent() are no longer
     available.  Use apr_getaddrinfo() instead.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Get "NameVirtualHost *" working in 2.0.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Return HTTP_RANGE_NOT_SATISFIABLE if the every range requested starts
     after the end of the response. [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Get byterange requests working with responses that do not have a
     content-length.  Because of the way byterange requests work, we have to
     have all of the data before we can actually do the byterange, so we
     can compute the content-length in the byterange filter.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Get exe CGI's working again on Windows.
     [Allan Edwards]

  *) Get mod_cgid and mod_rewrite to work as DSOs by changing the way
     they keep track of whether or not their  post config hook has been
     called before.  Instead of a static variable (which is replaced when 
     the DSO is loaded a second time), use userdata in the process pool.
     [Jeff Trawick]

Changes with Apache 2.0a9

  *) Win32 now requires perl to complete the final install step for users
     to build + install on Win32.  Makefile.win now rewrites @@ServerRoot@
     and installs the conf, htdocs and htdocs/manual directories.
     [William Rowe]

  *) Make mod_include use a hash table to associate directive tags with
     functions.  This allows modules to implement their own SSI tags easily.
     The idea is simple enough, a module can insert it's own tag and function
     combination into a hash table provided by mod_include.  While mod_include
     parses an SSI file, when it encounters a tag in the file, it does a
     hash lookup to find the function that implements that tag, and passes
     all of the relevant data to the function.  That function is then
     responsible for processing the tag and handing the remaining data back
     to mod_include for further processing.
     [Paul J. Reder <rederpj@raleigh.ibm.com>]

  *) Get rid of ap_new_apr_connection().  ap_new_connection() now has 
     fewer parameters: the local and remote socket addresses were removed
     from the parameter list because all required information is available
     via the APR socket.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Distribution directory structure reorganized to reflect a
     normal source distribution with external install targets.
     [Roy Fielding]

  *) The MPMs that need multiple segments of shared memory now create
     two apr_shmem_t variables, one for each shared memory allocation.
     the problem is that we can't determine how much memory will be required
     for shared memory allocations once we try to allocate more than one
     variable.  The MM code automatically aligns the shared memory allocations,
     so we end up needing to pad the amount of shared memory we want based
     on how many variables will be allocated out of the shared memory segment.
     It is just easier to create a second apr_shmem_t variable, and two
     shmem memory blocks.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Cleanup the export list a bit.  This creates a single unified list of
     functions exported by APR.  The export list is generated at configure
     time, and that list is then used to generate the exports.c file.
     Because of the way the export list is generated, we only export those
     functions that are valid on the platform we are building on.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Enable logging the cookie with mod_log_config
     [Sander van Zoest <sander@covalent.net>]

  *) Fix a segfault in mod_info when it reaches the end of the configuration.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Added lib/aputil/ as a placeholder for utility functions which are not
     specific to the Apache HTTP Server (but do not make sense with APR).
     The first utility is "apu_dbm": a set of functions to work with DBM
     files. This first version can be compiled for SDBM or GDBM databases.
     [Greg Stein]

  *) Complete re-write of mod_include.  This makes mod_include a filter that
     uses buckets directly.  This has now served the FAQ correctly.
     [Paul Reder <rederpj@raleigh.ibm.com>]

  *) Allow modules to specify the first filter in a sub_request when
     making the sub_request.  This keeps modules from having to change the
     output_filter immediately after creating the sub-request, and therefore
     skip the sub_req_output_filter.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Update ab to accept URLs with IPv6 literal address strings (in the
     format described in RFC 2732), and to build Host header fields in
     the same format.  This allows IPv6 literal address strings to be
     used with ab.  This support has been tested against Apache 1.3 with 
     the KAME patch, but Apache 2.0 does not yet work with this format
     of the Host header field.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Accomodate an out-of-space condition in the piped logs and the
     rotatelogs.c code, and no longer churn log processes for this
     condition.  [Victor J. Orlikowski]

  *) Add support for partial writes with apr_sendfile() to core_output_filter.
     [Greg Ames] 

Changes with Apache 2.0a8

  *) Add a directive to mod_mime so that filters can be associated with
     a given mime-type.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Get multi-views working again.  We were setting the path_info
     field incorrectly if we couldn't find the specified file.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Fix 304 processing.  The core should never try to send the headers
     down the filter stack.  Always, just setup the table in the request
     record, and let the header filter convert it to data that is ready
     for the network.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) More fixes for the proxy.  There are still bugs in the proxy code,
     but this has now proxied www.yahoo.com and www.ntrnet.net (my ISP)
     successfully.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Fix params for apr_getaddrinfo() call in connect proxy handler.
     [Chuck Murcko]

  *) APR: Add new apr_getopt_long function to handle long options.
     [B. W. Fitzpatrick <fitz@red-bean.com>]

  *) APR: Change apr_connect() to take apr_sockaddr_t instead of hostname.
     Add generic apr_create_socket().  Add apr_getaddrinfo() for doing
     hostname resolution/address string parsing and building
     apr_sockaddr_t.  Add apr_get_sockaddr() for getting the address
     of one of the apr_sockaddr_t structures for a socket.  Change
     apr_bind() to take apr_sockaddr_t.  [David Reid and Jeff Trawick]

  *) Remove the BUFF from the HTTP proxy.  This is still a bit ugly, but
     I have proxied pages with it, cleanup will commence soon.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Make the proxy work with filters.  This isn't perfect, because we
     aren't dealing with the headers properly.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Do not send a content-length iff the C-L is 0 and this is a head
     request.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Make cgi-bin work as a regular directory when using mod_vhost_alias
     with no VirtualScriptAlias directives. PR#6829 [Tony Finch]

  *) Remove BUFF from the PROXY connect handling. [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Get the default_handler to stop trying to deal with HEAD requests.
     The idea is to let the content-length filter compute the C-L before
     we try to send the data.  If we can get the C-L correctly, then we
     should send it in the HEAD response.
     [Ryan Bloom]
     
  *) The Header filter can now determine if a body should be sent based
     on r->header_only.  The general idea of this is that if we delay
     deciding to send the body, then we might be able to compute the
     content-length correctly, which will help caching proxies to cache
     our data better.  Any handler that doesn't want to try to compute
     the content-length can just send an EOS bucket without data and
     everything will just work.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Add the referer to the error log if one is available.
     [Markus Gyger <mgyger@itr.ch>]

  *) Mod_info.c has now been ported to Apache 2.0.  As a part of this
     change, the root of the configuration tree has been exposed to modules
     as ap_conftree.
     [Ryan Morgan <rmorgan@covalent.net>]

  *) Get the core_output_filter to use the bucket interface directly.
     This keeps us from calling the content-length filter multiple times
     for a simple static request.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) We are sending the content-type correctly now.
     [Ryan Bloom and Will Rowe]

  *) APR on FreeBSD: Fix a bug in apr_sendfile() which caused us to report
     a bogus bytes-sent value when the only thing being sent was trailers
     and writev() returned an error (or EAGAIN).  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Get SINGLE_LISTEN_UNSERIALIZED_ACCEPT working again.  This uses the
     hints file to determine which platforms define 
     SINGLE_LISTEN_UNSERIALIZED_ACCEPT.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) APR: add apr_get_home_directory()  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Initial import of 1.3-current mod_proxy. [Chuck Murcko]

  *) Not all platforms have INADDR_NONE defined by default.  Apache
     used to make this check and define INADDR_NONE if appropriate,
     but APR needs the check too, and I suspect other applications will
     as well.  APR now defines APR_INADDR_NONE, which is always a valid
     value on all platforms.
     [Branko Èibej <brane@xbc.nu>]

  *) Destroy the pthread mutex in lock_intra_cleanup() for PR#6824.
     [Shuichi Kitaguchi <ki@hh.iij4u.or.jp>] 

  *) Relax the syntax checking of Host: headers in order to support
     iDNS. PR#6635 [Tony Finch]

  *) When reading from file buckets we convert to an MMAP if it makes
     sense.  This also simplifies the default handler because the
     default handler no longer needs to try to create MMAPs.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) BUFF has been removed from the main server.  The BUFF code will remain
     in the code until it has been purged from the proxy module as well.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Byteranges have been completely re-written to be a filter.  This
     has been tested, and I believe it is working correctly, but it could
     doesn't work for the Adobe Acrobat plug-in.  The output almost matches
     the output from 1.3, the only difference being that 1.3 includes
     a content-length in the response, and this does not.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) APR read/write functions and bucket read functions now operate
     on unsigned integers, instead of signed ones.  It doesn't make
     any sense to use signed ints, because we return the error codes,
     so if we have an error we should report 0 bytes read or written.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Always compute the content length, whether it is sent or not.
     The reason for this, is that it allows us to correctly report
     the bytes_sent when logging the request.  This also simplifies
     content-length filter a bit, and fixes the actual byte-reporing
     code in mod_log_config.c
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Remove AP_END_OF_BRIGADE definition.  This does not signify what
     it says, because it was only used by EOS and FLUSH buckets.  Since
     neither of those are required at the end of a brigade, this was
     really signifying FLUSH_THE_DATA, but that can be determined better
     by checking AP_BUCKET_IS_EOS() or AP_BUCKET_IS_FLUSH.  EOS and FLUSH
     buckets now return a length of 0, which is actually the amount of data
     read, so they make more sense.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Allow the core_output_filter to save some data past the end of a
     request.  If we get an EOS bucket, we only send the data if it 
     makes sense to send it.  This allows us to pipeline request
     responses.  As a part of this, we also need to allocate mmap
     buckets out of the connection pool, not the request pool.  This
     allows the mmap to outlive the request.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Make blocking and non-blocking bucket reads work correctly for
     sockets and pipes.  These are the only bucket types that should
     have non-blocking reads, because the other bucket types should
     ALWAYS be able to return something immediately.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) In the Apache/Win32 console window, accept Ctrl+C to stop the 
     server, but use Ctrl+Break to initiate a graceful restart 
     instead of duplicating behavior. [John Sterling]

  *) Patch mod_autoindex to set the Last-Modified header based on
     the directory's mtime, and add the ETag header.  [William Rowe]

  *) Merge the 1.3 patch to add support for logging query string in 
     such a way that "%m %U%q %H" is the same as "%r".
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Port three log methods from mod_log_config 1.3 to 2.0: 
     CLF compliant '-' byte count, method and protocol.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Add a new LogFormat directive, %c, that will log connection
     status at the end of the response as follows:
     'X' - connection aborted before the response completed.
     '+' - connection may be kept-alive by the server.
     '-' - connection will be closed by the server.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Expand APR for WinNT to fully accept and return utf-8 encoded
     Unicode file names and paths for Win32, and tag the Content-Type 
     from mod_autoindex to reflect that charset if the the feature
     macro APR_HAS_UNICODE_FS is true.  [William Rowe]

  *) Compute the content length (and add appropriate header field) for
     the response when no content length is available and we can't use 
     chunked encoding.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Changed ap_discard_request_body() to use REQUEST_CHUNKED_DECHUNK,
     so that content input filters get dechunked data when using
     the default handler. Also removed REQUEST_CHUNKED_PASS.
     [Sascha Schumann]
     
  *) Add mod_ext_filter as an experimental module.  This module allows
     the administrator to use external programs as filters.  Currently,
     only filtering of output is supported.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Most Apache functions work on EBCDIC machines again, as protocol
     data is now translated (again).  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Introduce ap_xlate_proto_{to|from}_ascii() to clean up some of
     the EBCDIC support.  They are noops on ASCII machines, so this
     type of translation doesn't have to be surrounded by #ifdef
     CHARSET_EBCDIC.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix mod_include.  tag commands work again, and the server will
     send the FAQ again.  This also allows mod_include to set aside
     buckets that include partial buckets.
     [Ryan Bloom and David Reid]

  *) Add suexec support back.  [Manoj Kasichainula]

  *) Lingering close now uses the socket directly instead of using
     BUFF.  This has been tested, but since all we can tell is that it
     doesn't fail, this needs to be really hacked on.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Allow filters to modify headers and have those headers be sent to
     the client.  The idea is that we have an http_header filter that
     actually sends the headers to the network.  This removes the need
     for the BUFF to send headers.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Charset translation: mod_charset_lite handles translation of
     request bodies.  Get rid of the xlate version of ap_md5_digest()
     since we don't compute digests of filtered (e.g., translated) 
     response bodies this way anymore.  (Note that we don't do it at
     all at the present; somebody needs to write a filter to do so.)
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Input filters and ap_get_brigade() now have a input mode parameter 
     (blocking, non-blocking, peek) instead of a length parameter.
     [hackathon]

  *) Update the mime.types file to the registered media types as
     of 2000-10-19. PR#6613 [Carsten Klapp <carsten.klapp@home.net>,
     Tony Finch]

  *) Namespace protect some macros declared in ap_config.h
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Support HTTP header line folding with input filtering.
     [Greg Ames]

  *) Mod_include works again.  This should still be re-written, but at
     least now we can serve an SHTML page again.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Begin to remove BUFF from the core.  Currently, we keep a pointer
     to both the BUFF and the socket in the conn_rec.  Functions that
     want to use the BUFF can, functions that want to use the socket,
     can.  They point to the same place.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) apr_psprintf doesn't understand %lld as a format.  Make it %ld.
     [Tomas "Ögren" <stric@ing.umu.se>]

  *) APR pipes on Unix and Win32 are now cleaned up automatically when the 
     associated pool goes away.  (APR pipes on OS/2 were already had this
     logic.)  This resolvs a fatal file descriptor leak with CGIs.  
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) The final line of the config file was not being read if there was
     no \n at the end of it.  This was caused by apr_fgets returning 
     APR_EOF even though we had read valid data.  This is solved by
     making cfg_getline check the buff that was returned from apr_fgets.
     If apr_fgets return APR_EOF, but there was data in the buf, then we
     return the buf, otherwise we return NULL.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Piped logs work again in the 2.0 series.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Restore functionality broken by the mod_rewrite security fix:
     rewrite map lookup keys and default values are now expanded
     so that the lookup can depend on the requested URI etc.
     PR #6671 [Tony Finch]

  *) SECURITY: Tighten up the syntax checking of Host: headers to fix a
     security bug in some mass virtual hosting configurations
     that can allow a remote attacker to retrieve some files
     on the system that should be inaccessible. [Tony Finch]

  *) Add a pool bucket type.  This bucket is used for data allocated out
     of a pool.  If the pool is cleaned before the bucket is destroyed, then
     the data is converted to a heap bucket, allowing it to survive the
     death of the pool.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Add a flush bucket.  This allows modules to signal that the filters
     should all flush whatever data they currently have.  There is no way
     to actually force them to do this, so if a filter ignores this bucket,
     that's life, but at least we can try with this.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Add an output filter for sub-requests.  This filter just strips the
     EOS bucket so that we don't confuse the main request's core output
     filter by sending multiple EOS buckets.  This change also makes sub
     requests start to send EOS buckets when they are finished.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Make ap_bucket_(read|destroy|split|setaside) into macros.  Also
     makes ap_bucket_destroy a return void, which is okay because it
     used to always return APR_SUCCESS, and nobody ever checked its
     return value anyway.
     [Cliff Woolley <cliffwoolley@yahoo.com>]

  *) Remove the index into the bucket-type table from the buckets
     structure.  This has now been replaced with a pointer to the
     bucket_type.  Also add some macros to test the bucket-type.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Renamed all MODULE_EXPORT symbols to AP_MODULE_DECLARE and all symbols
     for CORE_EXPORT to AP_CORE_DECLARE (namespace protecting the wrapper)
     and retitled API_EXPORT as AP_DECLARE and APR_EXPORT as APR_DECLARE.
     All _VAR_ flavors changes to _DATA to be absolutely clear.
     [William Rowe]

  *) Add support for /, //, //servername and //server/sharename 
     parsing of <Directory> blocks under Win32 and OS2.
     [Tim Costello, William Rowe, Brian Harvard]

  *) Remove the function pointers from the ap_bucket type.  They have been
     replaced with a global table.  Modules are allowed to register bucket
     types and use then use those buckets.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) mod_cgid: In the handler, shut down the Unix socket (only for write) 
     once we finish writing the request body to the cgi child process; 
     otherwise, the client doesn't hit EOF on stdin.  Small request bodies 
     worked without this change (for reasons I don't understand), but large 
     ones didn't.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Remove file bucket specific information from the ap_bucket type.
     This has been moved to a file_bucket specific type that hangs off
     the data pointer in the ap_bucket type.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Input filtering now has a third argument.  This is the amount of data
     to read from lower filters.  This argument can be -1, 0, or a positive
     number.  -1 means give me all the data you have, I'll deal with it and
     let you know if I need more.  0 means give me one line and one line
     only.  A positive number means I want no more than this much data.

     Currently, only 0 and a positive number are implemented.  This allows
     us to remove the remaining field from the conn_rec structure, which
     has also been done.
     [Ryan Bloom] 
    
  *) Big cleanup of the input filtering.  The goal is that http_filter
     understands two conditions, headers and body.  It knows where it is
     based on c->remaining.  If c->remaining is 0, then we are in headers,
     and http_filter returns a line at a time.  If it is not 0, then we are
     in body, and http_filter returns raw data, but only up to c->remaining
     bytes.  It can return less, but never more.
     [Greg Ames, Ryan Bloom, Jeff Trawick]

  *) mod_cgi: Write all of the request body to the child, not just what
     the kernel would accept on the first write.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Back out the change that moved the brigade from the core_output_filters
     ctx to the conn_rec.  Since all requests over a given connection
     go through the same core_output_filter, the ctx pointer has the
     correct lifetime.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Fix another bug in the send_the_file() read/write loop. A partial
     send by apr_send would cause unsent data in the read buffer to
     get clobbered. Complete making send_the_file handle partial
     writes to the network.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Fix a couple of type fixes to allow compilation on AIX again
     [Victor J. Orlikowski <v.j.orlikowski@gte.net>]

  *) Fix bug in send_the_file() which causes offset to be ignored
     if there are no headers to send.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Handle APR_ENOTIMPL returned from apr_sendfile in the core
     filter. Useful for supporting Windows 9* with a binary
     compiled on Windows NT.
     [Bill Stoddard]

Changes with Apache 2.0a7

  *) Reimplement core_output_filter to buffer/save bucket brigades
     across multiple calls to the core_filter. The brigade will be
     sent when either MIN_BYTES_TO_SEND or MAX_IOVEC_TO_WRITE
     thresholds are hit or the EOS bucket is received.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Create experimental filter (buffer_filter) that coalesces bytes 
     into one large buffer before invoking the next filter in the
     chain. This filter is particularly useful with the current 
     implementation of mod_autoindex when it inserted above the
     chunk_filter. mod_autoindex generates a lot of brigades that
     containing buckets holding just a few bytes each. The
     buffer_filter coalesces these buckets into a single large bucket.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Add apr_sendfile() support into the core_output_filter.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Add apr_sendv() support into the core_output_filter.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Fix mod_log_config so that it compiles cleanly with BUFFERED_LOGS
     [Mike Abbott <mja@sgi.com>]

  *) Remove ap_send_fb.  This is no longer used in Apache, and it doesn't
     make much sense, because Apache uses buckets instead of BUFFs now.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) send_the_file now falls back to a read/write loop on platforms that
     do not have sendfile.
     [Ryan Bloom and Brian Havard]

  *) Install apachectl correctly, and substitute the proper values so
     that it works again.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Better(??) handle platforms that lack sendfile().
     [Jim Jagielski]

  *) APR now has UUID generation/formatting/parsing support.
     [Greg Stein]

  *) Begin the http_filter.  This is an input filter that understands
     the absolute basic amount required to parse an HTTP Request.  The
     goal is to be able to split headers from request body before passing
     the data back to the other filters.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Bring forward from 1.3.13 the config directory implementation
     [Jim Jagielski]

  *) install apxs if it is created
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Added APR_IS_STATUS_condition test macros to eliminate canonical error
     conversions.  [William Rowe]

  *) Now that we have ap_add_input_filter(), rename ap_add_filter() to 
     ap_add_output_filter().  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Multiple build and configuration fixes
    Build process:

      -add datadir and localstatedir substitutions
      -fix layout name
      -fix logfilename misspelling
      -fix evaluation of installation dir variables and
      -replace $foobar by $(foobar) to be usefull in the makefile
    
    Cross compile:
    
      -add rules for cross-compiling in rules.mk. Okay, rule to check for
       $CC_FOR_BUILD is still missing
      -use CHECK_TOOL instead of CHECK_PROG for ranlib
      -add missing "AR=@AR@" to severaly Makefile.in's
      -cache result for "struct rlimit"
      -compile all helper programs with native and cross compiler
       and use the native version to generate header file
     ["Rüdiger" Kuhlmann <Tadu@gmx.de>]

  *) Prepare our autoconf setup for autoconf 2.14a and for cross-
     compiling.
     ["Rüdiger" Kuhlmann <Tadu@gmx.de>]

  *) Fix a bug where a client which only sends \n to delimit header
     lines (netcat) gets a strange looking HTTP_NOT_IMPLEMENTED 
     message.  Start working on ebcdic co-existance with input 
     filtering.
     [William Rowe, Greg Ames]

  *) If mod_so is enabled in the server always create libexec, even
     if there are no modules installed in this directory.  This is a
     requirement for APXS to work correctly.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Connection oriented output filters are now stored in the 
     conn_rec instead of the request_rec.  This allows us to add the
     output filter in the pre-connection phase instead of the
     post_read_request phase, which keeps us from trying to write an
     error page before we have a filter to write to the network.
     [Ryan Bloom, Jeff Trawick, and Greg Ames]

  *) Cleaning up an mmap bucket no longer deletes the mmap.  An
     mmap can be used across multiple buckets (default_handler with
     byte ranges, mod_file_cache, mod_mmap_static), so cleanup of
     the mmap itself can't be associated with the bucket.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Add .dll caching directive ISAPICacheFile to mod_isapi.
     [William Rowe]

  *) Radical surgery to improve mod_isapi support under Win32.
     Includes a number of newer ServerSupportFunction calls, support
     for ReadClient (in order to retrieve POSTs greater than 48KB),
     and general bug fixes to more reliably load ISAPI .dll's and
     prevent leaking handle resources.  Note: There are still 
     discrepancies between IIS's and Apache's ServerVariables, and
     async calls are still not supported.  Additional warnings are
     logged to facilitate debugging of unsupported ISAPI calls.
     [William Rowe]

  *) Add input filtering to Apache.  The basic idea for the input
     filters is the same as the ideas for output filters.  The biggest
     difference is that instead of calling ap_pass_brigade, ap_get_brigade
     should be called, and the order of execution for the filter itself is
     different.  When writing an output filter, a brigade is passed in,
     and filters operate directly on that brigade, when done, they call
     ap_pass_brigade.  Input filters are the exact opposite.  Because input
     is not a push operation, filters first call ap_get_brigade.  When this
     function returns, the input filter will be left with a valid brigade.
     The input filter should then operate on the brigade, and return.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Fix building on BSD/OS using its native make. The build system
     falls back to the BSD .include directive on that host platform.
     [Sascha Schumann]

  *) Expand dbmmanage to allow -d -m -s -p options for Crypt, MD5,
     SHA1 and plaintext password encodings.  Make feature tests a
     bit more flexible.  [William Rowe]

  *) Charset translation: mod_charset_lite handles output content 
     translation in a filter.  mod_charset_lite no longer ignores 
     subrequests.  A bunch of cruft related to BUFF's support for
     translating request and response bodies was removed.  
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Move the addition of the CORE filter to the post_read_request
     hook in http_core.c.  This removes the need to add the filter in
     multiple places and allows for an SSL module to be added much
     simpler. [Ryan Bloom]

  *) SECURITY: CVE-2000-0913 (cve.mitre.org)
     Fix a security problem that affects certain configurations of
     mod_rewrite. If the result of a RewriteRule is a filename that
     contains expansion specifiers, especially regexp backreferences
     $0..$9 and %0..%9, then it may be possible for an attacker to
     access any file on the web server. [Tony Finch]

  *) Fix a bug where errors that are detected during early request parsing
     don't produce visible HTTP error messages at the browser, because
     the core_filter wasn't present.  [Greg Ames]

  *) Provide apr_socklen_t as a portability aid. 
     [Victor  J. Orlikowski]

  *) Overhaul of dbmmanage to allow a groups arg (as in Apache 1.2)
     as well as a comment arg to the add, adduser and update cmds.
     update allows the user to clear or preserve pw/groups/comment.
     Fixed a bug in dbmmanage that prevented the check option from 
     parsing a password followed by :group... text.  Corrected the
     seed calcualation for Win32 systems, and added -lsdbm support.
     [William Rowe]

  *) Configured mod_auth_dbm to compile with sdbmlib under Win32.
     [William Rowe]

  *) Avoid a segfault when parsing .htaccess files.  An 
     uninitialized tree pointer was passed to ap_build_config().
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Change the way that inet_addr & inet_network are checked for
     in APR's configure process to allow BeOS BONE to correctly
     find them. With this change BeOS BONE now builds from source
     with no problems.  [David Reid]

  *) Fix a bug in apr_create_process() for Unix.  The NULL signifying
     the end of the parameters to execve() was stored in the wrong
     location, overlaying the storage beyond the newargs[] array and 
     also passing uninitialized storage to execve(), which would 
     sometimes fail with EFAULT.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix a bug parsing configuration file containers.  With a sequence
     like this in the config file

       <IfModule mod_kilroy.c>
       any stuff
       </IfModule>
       <IfModule mod_lovejoy.c>
       (blank line)
       any stuff
       </IfModule>

     the second container would be terminated at the blank line due to
     sediment in the buffer from reading the prior </IfModule> and an 
     error message would be generated for the real </IfModule> for the
     second container.  Also due to this problem, any two characters 
     could be used for "</" in the close of a container.  
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) ap_add_filter prototype changed to remove the ctx pointer.  The
     pointer still remains in the filter structure, but it can not be
     a part of the ap_add_filter prototype.  The reason is that when
     the core uses AddFilter to add a filter to the stack it doesn't
     know how to allocate the ctx pointer, or even how much memory should
     be allocated.  The filters will have to be responsible for allocating
     the ctx memory when they need it.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Add an AddFilter directive.  This directive takes a list of filters
     that should be activated for the requested resource.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) apr_snprintf(): Get quad format strings working on OS/390 (and perhaps
     some other platforms).  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Modify mod_include to be a filter.  Currently, it has only been tested
     on actual files, but it should work for CGI scripts too.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) apr_putc(), apr_puts() for Unix: handle buffered files and interrupted
     writes.  apr_flush() for Unix: handle interrupted writes.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) NameVirtualHost can now take "*" as an argument instead of
     an IP address. This allows you to create a purely name-based
     virtual hosting server that does not have any IP addresses in
     the configuration file and which ignores the local address
     of any connections. PR #5595, PR #4455 [Tony Finch]

  *) Fix some compile warnings in mod_mmap_static.c
     [Mike Abbott <mja@sgi.com>]

  *) Fix chunking problem with CGI scripts.  The general problem was that
     the CGI modules were adding an EOS bucket and then the core added an
     EOS bucket.  The chunking filter finalizes the chunked response when it
     encounters an EOS bucket.  Because two EOS buckets were sent, we
     finalized the response twice.  The fix is to make sure we only send one
     EOS, by utilizing a flag in the request_rec.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) apr_put_os_file() now sets up the unget byte appropriately on Unix
     and Win32.  Previously, the first read from an apr_file_t set up via
     apr_put_os_file() would return a '\0'.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Mod_cgid now creates a single element bucket brigade, with a pipe
     bucket, instead of using BUFF's and ap_r*.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) APRVARS.in no longer overwrites the EXTRA_LIBS variable.
     [Mike Abbott <mja@sgi.com>]

  *) Remove ap_bopenf from buff code.  This required modifying the file_cache
     code to use APR file's directly instead of going through BUFFs.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Fix compile break on some platforms for mod_mime_magic.c
     [John K. Sterling <sterling@covalent.net>]

  *) Fix merging of AddDefaultCharset directive.
     PR #5872 (1.3) [Jun Kuriyama <kuriyama@imgsrc.co.jp>]

  *) Minor revamp of the rlimit sections of code. We now test
     explicitly for setrlimit and getrlimit. Also, unixd_set_rlimit()
     is now "available" even if the platform doesn't support
     the rlimit family (it's just a noop though). [Jim Jagielski]

  *) Migrate the pre-selection of which MPM to use for specific
     platforms to hints.m4, which contains (or should contain)
     all platform specific "hints". [Jim Jagielski]

  *) Remove IOLs from Apache.  With filtering, IOLs are no longer necessary
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Add tables with non-string/binary values to APR.
     [Ken Coar]

  *) Fix some bad calls to ap_log_rerror() in mod_rewrite. 
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Update PCRE to version 3.2.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Change the way buckets' destroy functions are called so that
     they can be more directly used when changing the type of a
     bucket in place. [Tony Finch]

  *) Add generic support for reference-counting the resources used by
     buckets, and alter the HEAP and MMAP buckets to use it. Change
     the way buckets are initialised to support changing the type of
     buckets in place, and use it when setting aside TRANSIENT buckets.
     Change the implementation of TRANSIENT buckets so that it can be
     mostly shared with IMMORTAL buckets, which are now implemented.
     [Tony Finch]

Changes with Apache 2.0a6

  *) Add support to Apache and APR for dsos on OS/390.  [Greg Ames]

  *) Add a chunking filter to Apache.  This brings us one step closer
     to removing BUFF. [Ryan Bloom]

  *) ap_add_filter now adds filters in a LIFO fashion.  The first filter
     added to the stack is the last filter to be called.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Apache 2.0 has been completely documented using Scandoc.  The
     docs can be generated by running 'make docs'.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Add filtered I/O to Apache.  This is based on bucket brigades,
     Currently the buckets still use BUFF under the covers, but that
     should change quickly.  The only currently written filter is the
     core filter which just calls ap_bwrite.  [The Apache Group]

  *) APR locks on Unix: Let APR_LOCKALL locks work when APR isn't
     built with thread support.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Abort configuration if --with-layout was specified and there's
     no layout definition file.  [Ken Coar]

  *) Add support for '--with-port=n' option to configure.  [Ken Coar]

  *) Add support for extension methods for the Allow response header
     field, and an API routine for accessing r->allowed and the
     list of extension methods in a unified manner.  [Ken Coar]

  *) mod_cern_meta: fix broken file reading loop in scan_meta_file().
     [Rob Simonson <simo@us.ibm.com>]

  *) Get xlate builds working again.  The apr renaming in 2.0a5 broke
     APACHE_XLATE builds.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) A configuration file parsing problem was fixed.  When the 
     configuration file started with an IfModule/IfDefine container, 
     only the last statement in the container would be retained.  
     [Jeff Trawick]

Changes with Apache 2.0a5

  *) Perchild is serving pages after passing them to different child
     processes.  There are still a lot of bugs, but this does work.  I
     have made requests against the same installation of Apache, and had
     different servers use different user IDs to serve the responses.
     This change moves to using socketpair instead of an AF_UNIX socket.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Perchild MPM still doesn't work perfectly, but it is serving pages.
     It can't seem to pass between child processes yet, but I think we
     are closer now than before.  This moves us back to using Unix
     Domain Sockets.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) libapr functions and types renamed with apr_ prefix.
     #include "apr_compat.h" for 1.3.x backwards compat
     [Perl]

  *) Fix problems with APR sockaddr handling on Win32.  It didn't always
     return the right information on the local socket address.
     [Gregory Nicholls <gnicholls@level8.com>]

  *) ap_recv() on Win32: Set bytes-read to 0 on error.  
     [Gregory Nicholls <gnicholls@level8.com>]

  *) Add an option to not detach from the controlling terminal without
     going into single process mode.  This allows for much easier
     debugging of the process startup code. [Ryan Bloom]

  *) ab: don't use perror() to report the failure of an APR function.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Make dexter, mpmt_pthread, and perchild MPMs not destroy the
     scoreboard on graceful restarts.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Fix segfault/SIGSEGV when running gzip from mod_mime_magic.c.
     An invalid ap_proc_t was passed to ap_create_process().
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Allow modules to register filters.  Those filters are still
     never called, but this is a step in the right direction.
     [Ryan Bloom and Greg Stein]

  *) Register the mod_cgid daemon process for cleanup so that it is
     killed at termination if it does not die when the parent gets
     SIGTERM.  This change is to fix occasional problems where the
     process stays around.  Bugs in similar logic in mod_rewrite and
     mod_include were also fixed.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix a bug in the time handling.  Basically, we were imploding a time
     in ap_parseHTTPdate, but it had bogus data in the exploded time format.
     Namely, tm_usec and tm_gmtoff were not filled out.  ap_implode_time
     uses those two fields to adjust the time value.  Because of the HTTP
     spec, both of those values can be zero'ed out safely.  This fixes
     the bug correctly.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Fix a couple of place in the Windows code where the wrong error
     code was being returned. [Gregory Nicholls <gnicholls@level8.com>]

  *) Fix POOL_DEBUG (at least for prefork mpm). [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Added the APR_EOL_STR macro for platform dependent differences in 
     logfiles and other raw text (such as all APR files).  Fixes logfiles
     not terminated with cr/lf sequences in Win32.  [William Rowe]

  *) Move all strings functions in APR to src/lib/apr/strings and create
     apr_strings.h for the prototypes. [Ryan Bloom]

  *) APR lock fixes: when using SysV sems, flock(), or fcntl(), be sure
     to repeat the syscall until we stop getting EINTR.  I noticed a
     related problem at termination (SIGTERM) on FreeBSD when using
     fcntl().  Apache 1.3 had these new loops too.  Also, make the flock() 
     implementation work properly with child init.  Previously, ap_lock()
     was essentially a no-op because all children were using different
     locks and thus nobody ever blocked.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) The htdocs/ tree has been moved out of the CVS source tree into
     a separate area for easier development.  This has NO EFFECT on
     end-users or Apache installations.  [Ken Coar]

  *) Integrate the mod_dav module for WebDAV protocol handling. This
     adds the dav and dav_fs modules, the SDBM library, and additional
     XML handling utilities. [Greg Stein]

  *) Clean out obsolete names (from httpd.h) for the HTTP Status Codes
     [Greg Stein]

  *) Update the lib/expat-lite/ library (bring forward changes from
     the Apache 1.3 repository). [Greg Stein]

  *) If sizeof(long long) == sizeof(long), then prefer long in APR
     configure.in.  [Dave Hill <ddhill@zk3.dec.com>]

  *) Add ap_sendfile for Tru64 Unix.  Also, add an error message for
     machines where sendfile is detected, but nobody has written ap_sendfile.
     [Dave Hill <ddhill@zk3.dec.com>]

  *) Compile fixes in mod_mmap_static.  [Victor J. Orlikowski]

  *) ab would start up more connections than needed, then quit when the
     desired number were finished. Also fixed a logic error involving
     ab keepalives.  [Victor J. Orlikowski]

  *) WinNT: Implement non-blocking pipes with timeouts to communicate
     with CGIs. Apache 2.0a4 had non-blocking pipes but without 
     timeouts (i.e, if a timeout was specified, the pipe reverted to
     a full blocking pipe). Now the behaviour is more in line with
     Unix non-blocking pipes.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) WinNT: Implement accept socket reuse. Using mod_file_cache to
     cache open file handles along with accept socket reuse enables
     Apache 2.0 to serve non-keepalive requests for static files at
     3x the rate of Apache 1.3.(e.g, Apache 1.3 will serve 400 rps
     and Apache 2.0 will serve almost 1200 rps on my system).
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Merge mod_mmap_static function into mod_file_cache. mod_file_cache
     supports two config directives, mmapfile (same behavious as
     mod_mmap_static) and cachefile. Use the cachefile directive
     to cache open file handles. This directive only works on systems
     that have implemented the ap_sendfile API. cachefile works today
     on Windows NT, but has not been tested on any flavors of Unix.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Cleanup the configuration.  With the last few changes the
     configuration process automatically:
         inherits information about how to build from APR.  Allowing
         APR to inform Apache that it should or should not use -ldl
        
         Detects which mod_cgi should be used mod_cgi or mod_cgid,
         based on the threading model

         Apache calls APR's configure process before finishing it's
         configuration processing, allowing for more information flow
         between the two.
     [Ryan Bloom]
         

  *) Change Unix and Win32 ap_setsockopt() so that APR_SO_NONBLOCK
     with non-zero argument makes the socket non-blocking.  BeOS and
     OS/2 already worked this way.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) ap_close() now calls ap_flush() for buffered files, so write
     operations work a whole lot better on buffered files.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix error messages issued from MPMs which explain where to change
     compiled-in limits (e.g., ThreadsPerChild, MaxClients, StartTreads).
     [Greg Ames]

  *) ap_create_pipe() now leaves pipes in blocking state.  (This helps 
     reduce the number of syscalls on Unix.)  ap_set_pipe_timeout() is
     now the way that the blocking state of a pipe is manipulated.
     ap_block_pipe() is gone.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Correct the problem where the only local host name that the IP stack
     can discover are 'undotted' private names.  If no fully qualified
     domain name can be identified, the default ServerName will be set to
     the machine's IP address string. A warning is always provided if the
     ServerName not specified, but assumed.  Solves PR6215 [William Rowe]

  *) Repair problems with config file processing which caused segfault
     at init when virtual hosts were defined and which caused ServerName to
     be ignored when there was no valid DNS setup.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Removed pointless ap_is_aborted macro function. [Roy Fielding]

  *) Add ap_sendfile implementation for AIX
     [Victor J. Orlikowski]

  *) Repair C++ compatibility in ap_config.h, apr_file_io.h, 
     apr_network_io.h, and apr_thread_proc.h.  
     [Tyler J. Brooks <tylerjbrooks@home.com>, Jeff Trawick]

  *) Bring the allocation and pool debugging code back into a working
     state.  This will need to be tested as so far it's only been used on
     BeOS. [David Reid]

  *) Change configuration command setup to be properly typesafe when in
     maintainer mode. Note that this requires a compiler that can initialise
     unions. [Ben Laurie]

  *) Turn on buffering for config file reads.  Part of this was to
     repair buffered I/O support in Unix and implement buffered
     ap_fgets() for all platforms.  [Brian Havard, Jeff Trawick]

  *) Win32: Fix problem where UTC offset was not being set correctly
     in the access log. Problem reported on news group by Jerry Baker.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Fix segfault when reporting this type of syntax error:
     "</container> without matching <container> section", where
     container is VirtualHost or Directory or whatever.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) SECURITY: CAN-2000-1204 (cve.mitre.org)
     Prevent the source code for CGIs from being revealed when 
     using mod_vhost_alias and the CGI directory is under the document root
     and a user makes a request like http://www.example.com//cgi-bin/cgi
     as reported in <news:960999105.344321@ernani.logica.co.uk>
     [Tony Finch]

  *) Add support for the new Beos NetwOrking Environment (BONE)
     [David Reid]

  *) xlate: ap_xlate_conv_buffer() now tells the caller when the
     final input char is incomplete; ap_bwrite_xlate() now handles
     incomplete final input chars.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Yet another update to saferead/halfduplex stuff -- need to ensure
     that a bhalfduplex call occurs before logging or else DNS and
     such can delay the last packet of the response.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Some syscall reduction in APR on unix -- don't seek when setting
     up an mmap; and don't fcntl() more than once per socket.
     [Dean Gaudet]

  *) When mod_cgid is started as root, the cgi daemon now switches 
     to the configured User/Group (like other httpd processes) 
     instead of continuing as root.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) The prefork MPM now uses an APR lock for the accept() mutex.
     It has not been getting a lock at all recently.  httpd -V now 
     displays APR's selection of the lock mechanism instead of the 
     symbols previously respected by prefork.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Change the mmap() feature test to check only for existence.
     The previous check required features not used by Apache.
     [Greg Ames]

  *) Fix a couple of bugs in mod_cgid:  The cgi arguments were
     sometimes mangled.  The len parm to accept() was not 
     initialized, leading sometimes to an endless loop of failed
     accept() calls on OS/390 and anywhere else that failed the call
     if the len was negative.  Use <sys/un.h> for struct sockaddr_un
     instead of declaring it ourselves to fix a compilation problem
     on Solaris.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Add Resource limiting code back into Apache 2.0. [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Fix zombie process problem with mod_cgi.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Port mod_mmap_static to 2.0.  Make it go faster.  [Greg Ames]

  *) Fix storage overlay when loading dsos.  Symptom: Apache dies at
     initialization if ALLOC_DEBUG is defined; no known symptom 
     otherwise.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix typo in configure script when checking for mod_so.  bash
     doesn't seem to have a problem but /bin/sh on Solaris does.
     Symptom: "./configure: test: unknown operator =="
     [Jeff Trawick]
   
  *) Rebind the Win32 NT and 9x services control into the MPM.  
     All console, WinNT SCM and Win9x pseudo-service control code is
     now wrapped within the WinNT MPM.
     [William Rowe]

  *) Make a copy of getenv("PATH") before storing for later use.  Some
     getenv() implementations use the same storage for successive calls.
     CGIs on OS/390 had a bad PATH due to this.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Server Tokens work in 2.0 again.  This also propogates the change
     to allow just the product name in the server string using
     PRODUCT_ONLY.
     [Ryan Bloom]

Changes with Apache 2.0a4

  *) EBCDIC: Rearrange calls to ap_checkconv() so that most handlers
     won't need to call it.  [Greg Ames, Jeff Trawick]

  *) Move pre_config hook call to between configuration read and config
     tree walk.  This allows all modules to implement pre_config hooks
     and know that they will be called at an appropriate time.
     [Ryan Bloom] 

  *) mod_cgi, mod_cgid: Make ScriptLog directive work again.  
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Add pre-config hooks back to all modules.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Fix a SIGSEGV in ap_md5digest(), which is used when you have
     ContentDigest enabled and we can't/don't mmap the file. 
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) We now report the correct line number for syntax errors in config
     files.  [Ryan Bloom, Greg Stein, Jeff Trawick]

  *) Brought mod_auth_digest up to synch with 1.3, fixed ap_time_t-
     related bugs, and changed shmem/locking to use apr API. Shared-mem
     is currently disabled, however, because of problems with graceful
     restarts. [Ronald Tschalär]

  *) Fix corruption of IFS variable in --with-module= handling.  
     Depending on the user's shell or customization thereof, there 
     would be errors generating ap_config_auto.h later in the configure
     procedure.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) mod_cgi: Restore logging of stderr from child process when ScriptLog 
     isn't used (as in 1.3), except that on Unix it is now logged via 
     ap_log_rerror() instead of by the child having STDERR_FILENO refer
     to the error log.  [Greg Ames, Jeff Trawick]

  *) Add '-D' argument processing for run time configuration defines.
     [William Rowe]

  *) Organize http_main.c as independent code, such that no code or
     global data is exported from it.  WIN32 will dynamically link it
     to the server core, so this will prevent mutual dependency.
     [William Rowe]

  *) Add separate dynamic linkage tags APR_EXPORT(), APR_EXPORT_NONSTD()
     and APR_VAR_EXPORT to correctly resolve apr functions and globals.
     [William Rowe]

  *) Add Win9x service execution and Ctrl+C/Ctrl+Break/Shutdown handlers.
     [William Rowe, Jan Just Keijser <KEIJSERJJ@logica.com>]

  *) Add mod_charset_lite for configuring character set translation.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Add '-n' option to htpasswd to make it print its user:pw record
     on stdout rather than having to frob a text file.  [Ken Coar]

  *) Fix saferead.  Basically, we flush the output buffer if a read on the
     input will block.
     [Ryan Bloom]
 
  *) APR: Add ap_xlate_get_sb() so that an app can find out whether or not
     a conversion is single-byte only. [Jeff Trawick]

  *) BEOS: ap_shutdown should return APR_SUCCESS or errno. Note that
     the BeOS 5.0 documentation says that shutdown doesn't work yet.
     [Roy Fielding]

  *) Fix some minor errors where pid was being manipulated as an int
     instead of the portable pid_t.  [Roy Fielding]

  *) Fix some error log prints that were printing the pointer to a
     structure rather than the pid within the structure.
     [Jeff Trawick, Roy Fielding]

  *) ab: Fix a command-line processing bug; track bad headers in 
     err_response; support reading headers up to 2K. 
     [Ask Bjoern Hansen <ask@valueclick.com>]

  *) Fix ap_resolve_env() so that it handles new function added in a prior
     alpha (see "Added the capability to do ${ENVVAR} constructs in the
     config file.") as well as the constructs used by mod_rewrite.
     [Paul Reder <rederpj@raleigh.ibm.com>]

  *) Apache 2.0 builds and runs on OS/390. [Jeff Trawick, Greg Ames]

  *) Change the EBCDIC support in functions for MD5, SHA1, and base 64 to use
     APR to perform translation, instead of accessing the hard-coded tables
     in 1.3's ebcdic.c. [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix some bugs (mostly lost 1.3 code) in ab's command-line processing. 
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Add the ability to hook into the config file reading phase.  Basically
     if a directive is specified EXEC_ON_READ, then when that directive is
     read from the config file, the assocaited function is executed.  This
     should only be used for those directives that must muck with HOW the
     server INTERPRETS the config.  This should not be used for directives
     that re-order or replace items in the config tree.  Those changes should
     be made in the pre-config step.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Add mod_example to the build system.
     [Tony Finch]

  *) APR: Add ap_xlate_conv_byte() to convert one char between single-
     byte character sets. [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Pick up various EBCDIC fixes from 1.3 (from Martin
     Kraemer and Oliver Reh originally according to the change log).
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix a couple of problems in RFC1413 support (controlled by the
     IdentityCheck directive).  Apache did not build the request string
     properly and more importantly Apache would loop forever if the 
     would-be ident server dropped the connection before sending a
     properly terminated response. [Jeff Trawick]

  *) apxs works in 2.0.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Reliable piped logs work in 2.0.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Introduce a hash table implementation into APR to be used for
     replacing tables and other random data structures in Apache.
     [Tony Finch]

  *) Add some more error reporting to htpasswd in the case of problems
     generating or accessing the temporary file.  Also, pass in a
     buffer if the implementation knows how to use it (i.e., if L_tmpnam
     is defined).  [Ken Coar]

  *) Configure creates config.nice now containing your configure
     options. Syntax: ./config.nice [--more-options]
     [Sascha Schumann]

  *) Fix various return code problems in APR on Win32.  For most of
     these, APR was returning APR_EEXIST instead of GetLastError()/
     WSAGetLastError().  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Make piped logs work again in version 2.0
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Add VPATH support to UNIX build system of Apache and APR.
     [Sascha Schumann]

  *) Fix ap_tokenize_to_argv to respect the const arguments that are
     passed to it.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Fix mm's memcpy/memset macros, pointer arithmetic was broken.
     Patch submitted to author.
     [Sascha Schumann]

  *) Fix mm configuration on Solaris 8 x86 and OS/390.  Don't require
     /sbin in PATH on FreeBSD (all submitted to rse previously) 
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix building Pthread-based MPMs on OpenBSD
     [Sascha Schumann] PR#26

  *) Fix ap_readdir() problem on systems where d_name[] field in
     struct dirent is declared with only one byte.  (This problem only 
     affected multithreaded builds.)  This caused a segfault during
     pool cleanup with mod_autoindex on Solaris (Solaris 8 x86, at 
     least). [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix some make-portability problems on at least Tru64, Irix
     and UnixWare.
     [Sascha Schumann] PR#18, PR#39

  *) Add ap_sigwait() to support old-style sigwait() on systems
     like OS/390 and UnixWare.
     [Sascha Schumann] 

  *) Add POSIX-thread flags for more platforms.
     [Sascha Schumann]

  *) Fix some minor bugs in ap_strerror().  Teach ap_strerror()
     (on Unix, at least) to handle resolver errors.  Fix a bug in
     the definition of APR_ENOMEM so that ap_strerror() can spit
     out the correct error message for it.
     [Jeff Trawick]

Changes with Apache 2.0a3

  *) mod_so reports ap_os_dso_error() if ap_dso_load() fails
     [Doug MacEachern]

  *) API: *HOOK* macros now have an AP_ prefix
     [Doug MacEachern]

  *) Win32: Eliminate redundant calls to initialize winsock.
     [Tim Costello <timcostello@ozemail.com.au>]

  *) Fix bugs initializing ungetchar for pipes. 
     [Chia-liang Kao <clkao@CirX.ORG>]

  *) The ab program in the src/support directory is now portable using
     APR.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Support directory is being compiled when the server is built
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) The configure option --with-program-name has been added to allow
     developers to rename the executable at configure time.  This also
     changes the name of the config files to match the executable's name.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) mod_autoindex: Add `IndexOptions +VersionSort', to nicely sort filenames
     containing version numbers. [Martin Pool]

  *) ap_open(..,APR_OS_DEFAULT,..) uses perms 0666 instead of 0777 on
     Unix; access_log and error_log now created with these perms; non-
     Unix is unaffected [Jeff Trawick]
     
  *) Finished move of ap_md5 routines to apr_md5.  Removed ap_md5.h.
     Replaced more magic numbers with MD5_DIGESTSIZE.
     [William Rowe, Roy Fielding]

  *) Win32: Get mod_auth_digest compiling and added to the Windows
     build environment. Not tested and I'd be suprised if it 
     actually works. [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Revamp the Win32 make environment. Makefiles have been removed and
     Apache.dsw created to bring together all the pieces. Create new file
     os/win32/BaseAddr.ref to define module base addresses (to prevent
     dll relocation at start-up).
     [William Rowe, Greg Marr, Tim Costello, Bill Stoddard]

  *) [EBCDIC] Port Paul Gilmartin's CRLF patch from 1.3.  This replaces most
     of the \015, \012, and \015\012 constants with macros.
     [Greg Ames]
     
  *) Add ap_xlate_open() et al for translation of text between different 
     character sets.  The initial implementation requires iconv().
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) More FAQs and answers from comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix.
     [Joshua Slive <slive@finance.commerce.ubc.ca>]

  *) CGI output is being timed out now.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Fix the problem with dieing quietly.  dupfile now takes a pool which
     is used by the new apr file.  There is no reason to create a new file
     with the same lifetime as the original file.
     [Ryan Bloom] 

  *) Win32: Attempt to eliminate dll relocation at start-up by specifying
     module base addresses. This will help shooting seg faults
     in the field. [William Rowe <wrowe@lnd.com>]

  *) Update Apache on Windows documentation. Add new document
     describing how to compile Apache on Windows.
     [William Rowe <wrowe@lnd.com>]

  *) ap_set_pipe_timeout(), ap_poll(), and APR_SO_TIMEOUT now take 
     microseconds instead of seconds.  Some storage leaks and other
     minor bugs in related code were fixed.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Win32: First cut at getting mod_isapi working under 2.0
     [William Rowe <wrowe@lnd.com>]

  *) First stab at getting mod_auth_digest working under 2.0
     quick change summary:
     - moved the random byte generation (ap_generate_random_bytes) into APR
     - now uses ap_time_t
     - compiles and runs on linux
     - tested with amaya
     [Brian Martin <bmartin@penguincomputing.com>]

  *) Win32: Move the space stripping of physical service names
     fix up from Apache 1.3. #include'ing "ap_mpm.h" fixes up an
     unresolved symbol. Add dependency checking to the
     CreateService call to ensure TCPIP and AFP (winsock) is started
     before Apache.
     [William Rowe <wrowe@lnd.com>]

  *) Win32: Add code to perform latebinding on functions that may
     not exist on all levels of Windows where Apache runs. This
     is needed to allow Apache to start-up on Win95/98. All calls
     to non portable functions should be protected with
     ap_oslevel checks to prevent runtime segfaults. 
     [William Rowe <wrowe@lnd.com>]

  *) Fix fallback default values for SHM_R and SHM_W [Martin Kraemer]

  *) Get lingering_close() working again. [Dean Gaudet, Jeff Trawick]

  *) Win32: Get non-blocking CGI pipe reads working under Windows NT.
     This addresses PR 1623. Still need to address timing out runaway
     CGI scripts. [Bill Stoddard]
 
  *) Win32: Make ap_stat Windows 95/98 friendly
     [William Rowe <wrowe@lnd.com>]                                            

  *) Win32: Fix a bug in ap_get_oslevel which causes GetVersionEx() to 
     always fail. Need to initialise the dwOSVersionInfoSize member of the 
     OSVERSIONINFO struct before calling GetVersionEx, so GetVersionEx 
     always fails. 

     The patch also enhances ap_get_oslevel (and the associated enum) to 
     handle selected service packs for NT4, and adds recognition for 
     Windows 2000. This is useful, eg. if we can recognise NT4 SP2 then 
     we can use ReadFileScatter and WriteFileGather in readwrite.c. 
     [Tim Costello <Tim.Costello@BTFinancialgroup.com>]

  *) Get mod_rewrite building and running, and mod_status building for Win NT
     [Allan Edwards <ake@raleigh.ibm.com>]

  *) Patch to port mod_auth_db to the 2.0 api and also to support 
     Berlekey DB 3.0. It works for me with both Berkeley DB 3.0.55 and 
     2.7.7.  It should work with version 1 as well but I haven't tested it.  
     [Brian Martin <bmartin@penguincomputing.com>]

  *) Get APR DSO code working under Windows. Includes cross platform
     fixes to mod_so.c.
     [Tim.Costello@BTFinancialgroup.com]

  *) Fix some of the Windows APR time functions.
     [William Rowe]

  *) FAQ changes related to tidying up historical documents on the web site.
     [Joshua Slive <slive@finance.commerce.ubc.ca>]

  *) Move Windows DSO code into APR.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Eliminate apr_win.h and apr_winconfig.h (and the ugly #ifdefs they cause).
     Now, apr.h and apr_config.h are generated from apr.hw and apr_config.hw
     at build time. At this point, the server will not compile on Windows because
     of the recent DSO commits. Fixing those next.
     [Bill Rowe & Bill Stoddard]

  *) Added error checking for file I/O APR routines.
     [Jon Travis <jtravis@covalent.net>]

  *) APR: Don't use the values of resolver error codes for the 
     corresponding APR error codes.  On Unix and Win32, return the 
     proper APR error code after a resolver error. [Jeff Trawick]

Changes with Apache 2.0a2

  *) Renamed the executable back to httpd on all platforms other 
     than Win32
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Allow BeOS to survive restarts, log properly and a few
     small things it had problems with due to the way it setup
     users and groups. [David Reid]

  *) Get mod_rewrite working with APR locks
     [Paul Reder <rederpj@raleigh.ibm.com>]

  *) Actually remove the sempahore when the lock cleanup routine
     is called on BeOS. [David Reid]

  *) Clear hook registrations between reads of the config file.
     When DSOs are unloaded and re-loaded the old hook pointers may
     no longer be valid. This fix eliminates potential segfaults.
     [Allan Edwards <ake@raleigh.ibm.com>]

  *) Fix a problem with Sigfunc not being defined or bypassed
     if sigaction() wasn't found. [Jim Jagielski]

  *) Fix the locking mechanism on BSD variants.  They now use fcntl
     locks.  This allows the server to start and serve pages.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) First cut at getting the Win32 installer to work
     [William Rowe <wrowe@lnd.com>]

  *) Get htpasswd compiling under Windows
     [William Rowe <wrowe@lnd.com>]

  *) Change the log message for a bind() failure to show the
     interface and port number. [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Import the documentation from 1.3.12 and bring parts of it
     up-to-date with respect to the changes that have occurred
     in 2.0.
     [Tony Finch]

  *) BeOS MPM updated.  CGI bug on BeOS fixed.  IP addresses
     now logged correctly on BeOS.
     [David Reid]

  *) Create one makefile for all Win32 distributions (NT/2000/95/98).
     Makefile.win includes the same user interface as the old 
     Makefile.nt 
     [William Rowe <wrowe@lnd.com>, Jeff Trawick <trawick@us.ibm.com>]

  *) Win32 exec now uses COMSPEC environment string for command 
     shell path resolution.
     [William Rowe <wrowe@lnd.com>] PR#3715

  *) Win32: ap_connect() was not returning correct error condition
     PR5866
     [Allen Prescott <allen@clanprescott.com>]

  *) Win32: ap_open() was broken on Win9x because an NT-specific
     flag was passed to CreateFile.  ap_puts() added an unnecessary
     '\n'.
     [Jeff Trawick <trawick@us.ibm.com>]

  *) Put in Korean and Norwegian index.html pages (2.0 and 1.3)
     which where donated by Lee Kuk Hyun and Lorant Czaran. 'Fixed'
     confusing ee/et name and made all extensions language/dialect
     rather than country reflecting. Changed example files to
     explicit reflect the ISO charset and added a few common 
     ones to the example config [dirkx]

  *) Extend external module capability.  To use this, you call
     configure with --with-module=path/to/mod1,path/to/mod2,etc.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Backported the various "default charset" fixes from 1.3.12,
     including the AddDefaultCharset directive. [Jim Jagielski]

  *) Added the capability to do ${ENVVAR} constructs in the
     config file. E.g. 'ServerAdmin ${POSTMASTER}'. As commited
     it does this on a line by line basis; i.e. if the envvar
     expands to something with spaces you have to protect it
     by adding quotes around it (Unless of course you expect it
     to contains more than one argument. Alternatively you
     can compile it on a per token basis; which is what people
     usually expect by setting RESOLVE_ENV_PER_TOKEN. But this
     hampers fancier hacks.
     [Dirk-Willem van Gulik]

  *) Changed the 'ErrorDocument' syntax in that it NO longer
     supports the asymetric

                ErrorDocument 301 "Some message

     Note the opening " quote, without a closing quote. It now
     has either the following syntaxes

                ErrorDocument XXX /local/uri
                ErrorDocument XXX http://valid/url
                ErrorDocument XXX "Some Message"

     The recognition heuristic is: if it has a space it
     is a message. If it has no spaces and starts with a /
     or is a valid URL then treat it that way. Otherwise it
     is assumed to be a message.

     This breaks backward compatibility but makes live a hell
     of a lot easier for GUI's and config file parsers.
     [Dirk-Willem van Gulik]

  *) Changed 'CacheNegotiatedDocs' from its present/not-present
     syntax into a 'on' or 'off' syntax. As it currently is the
     only non nesting token which uses NO_ARGS and thus is an
     absolute pain for any config interface automation. This
     breaks backward compatibility. [Dirk-Willem van Gulik]

  *) Add ability to add external modules to the build process.  This is
     done with --with-module=/path/to/module.  Modules can only be added
     as static modules at this point.
     [Ryan Bloom]

Changes with Apache 2.0a1

  *) Fix FreeBSD 3.3 core dump.
     Basically, ap_initialize() needs to get called before 
     create_process(), since create_process() passes op_on structure
     to semop() to get a lock, but op_on isn't initialized until 
     ap_initialize() calls setup_lock().  Here is a slight
     rearrangement to main() which calls ap_initialize() earlier...
     [Jeff Trawick <trawick@us.ibm.com>]

  *) Enable Apache to use sendfile/TransmitFile API
     [Bill Stoddard, David Reid, Paul Reder]

  *) Re-Implement Win32 APR network I/O APIs and most of the file I/O
     APIs.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Make file I/O and network I/O writev/sendv APIs consistent.
     Eliminate use of ap_iovec_t and use Posix struct iovec.
     Use seperate variable on ap_writev to set the number of iovecs
     passed in and number of bytes written.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Adapt file iol to use APR functions. Replaced ap_open_file() 
     with ap_create_file_iol(). ap_create_file_iol() requires that 
     the file be opened prior to the call using ap_open().
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Port mod_include and mod_cgi to 2.0
     [Paul Reder, Bill Stoddard]

  *) ap_send{,v}, ap_recv, ap_sendfile API clarification --
     bytes_read/bytes_written is always valid (never -1).  Plus
     some fixes to buff.c to correct problems introduced by the
     errno => ap_status_t changes a while back.  Plus a fix to
     chunked encoding introduced right at the beginning of 2.0.
     [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Revamped UNIX build system to use autoconf and libtool.
     [Manoj Kasichainula, Sascha Schumann]

  *) port mod_rewrite to 2.0. [Paul J. Reder <rederpj@raleigh.ibm.com>]

  *) SECURITY: More rigorous checking of Host: headers to fix security 
     problems with mass name-based virtual hosting (whether using mod_rewrite
     or mod_vhost_alias).
     [Ben Hyde, Tony Finch]
  
  *) Add back support for UseCanonicalName in <Directory> containers.
     [Manoj Kasichainula]

  *) Added APLOG_STARTUP log type.  This allows us to write an error
     message without any of the date and time information.  As a part
     of this change, I also removed all of the calls to fprintf(stderr
     and replaced them with calls to ap_log_error using APLOG_STARTUP
     writing to stderr is no longer portable, because we don't direct 
     stderr to the error log on all platforms.
     [Ryan Bloom] 
 
  *) Convert error logging functions to take errno as an argument.
     This makes our error logs more portable, because some Windows API's 
     don't set errno.  This change allows us to still output a valid
     message on all of our platforms.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) mod_mime_magic runs in 2.0-dev now.
     [Paul Reder <rederpj@raleigh.ibm.com>]

  *) sendfile has been added to APR.
     [John Zedlewski <zedlwski@Princeton.EDU>]

  *) buff.c has been converted to no longer use errno.
     [Manoj Kasichainula]

  *) mod_speling runs in 2.0-dev now: a bug in readdir_r handling and
     interface adaption to APR functions did it. [Martin Kraemer]

  *) Support DSOs properly on 32-bit HP-UX 11.0
     [Dilip Khandekar <dilip@cup.hp.com>]

  *) Updated MM in APR source tree from version 1.0.8 to 1.0.11
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Cleaned APR build environment integration and bootstrap APR 
     automatically for developers from src/Configure.
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Fixed building of src/support/htpasswd.c
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) When generating the Location: header, mod_speling forgot
     to escape the spelling-fixed uri. (Forw-Port from 1.3)
     [Martin Kraemer]

  *) Moved mod_auth_digest.c from experimental to standard. [Roy Fielding]

  *) Change all pools to APR contexts.  This is the first step to
     incorporating APR into Apache. [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Move "handler not found" warning message to below the check
     for a wildcard handler.  [Dirk <dirkm@teleport.com>, Roy Fielding]
     PR#2584, PR#2751, PR#3349, PR#3436, PR#3548, PR#4384, PR#4795, PR#4807

  *) Support line-continuation feature in config.option file and
     allow the loading of multiple option sections at once via
     ``--with-option=<section1>,<section2>,...''
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Rebuilt CVS repository with Apache 1.3.9 as basis.  [Roy Fielding]

Changes with Apache MPM

  *) Use asynchronous AcceptEx() and a completion port to accept and
     dispatch connections to threads in Windows NT/2000. 
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Implement WINNT Win32 MPM from original Win32 code in http_main.c
     [Bill Stoddard]  

  *) Implement the APACI --with-option facility 
     (per default used the config.option file).
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) MPM BEOS port.  [David Reid <abb37@dial.pipex.com>]

  *) Start to implement module-defined hooks that are a) fast and b) typesafe.
     Replace pre_connection module call with a register_hook call and
     implement pre_connection as a hook. The intent is that these hooks will
     be extended to allow Apache to be multi-protocol, and also to allow the
     calling order to be specified on a per-hook/per-module basis.
     [Ben Laurie]

  *) Implement mpm_* methods as "modules". Each method gets its own
     subdir in src/modules (eg: src/modules/prefork). Selection
     of method uses Rule MPM_METHOD.  [Jim Jagielski]

  *) Port the hybrid server from the apache-apr repository as
     mpm_mpmt_pthread.  [Manoj Kasichainula]

  *) os/unix/unixd.[ch]: detach, setuid, setgid, stuff which will be common
     amongst the unix MPMs.

  *) mpm_prefork: throw away all the alarm/timeout crud; and clean up the
     signal handling for the new world order.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Crude ap_thread_mutex abstraction so that we get the pthread stuff out
     of alloc.c for now.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Handle partial large writes correctly.  [Ben Laurie]

  *) Eliminate conn_rec's pointer to server. All it knows is the base server
     based on IP/port.  [Ben Laurie]

  *) Port a bunch of modules to the new module structure.
     ["Michael H. Voase" <mvoase@midcoast.com.au>]

  *) I/O layering and BUFF revamp.  See docs/buff.txt.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Basic restructuring to introduce the MPM concept; includes various
     changes to the module API... better described by
     docs/initial_blurb.txt.  [Dean Gaudet]

Changes with Apache pthreads

  *) New buff option added: BO_TIMEOUT. It describes the timeout for
     buff operations (generally over a network).
     [Dean Gaudet, Ryan Bloom, Manoj Kasichainula]

  *) Created http_accept abstraction. Added 4 new functions (not exported):
     init_accept(), begin_accepting_requests(), get_request(), 
     stop_accepting_requests() [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Fix to ap_rprintf call that allows mod_info to work properly.
     [James Morris <jmorris@intercode.com.au>]

  *) user and ap_auth_type fields were moved from connection_rec to 
     request_rec. [Ryan Bloom] 

  *) Removed the ap_block_alarms and ap_unblock_alarm calls.  These aren't
     needed in a threaded server.

  *) Initial pthread implementation from from Dean's apache-nspr code.
     [Bill Stoddard, Ryan Bloom]


Changes with Apache 1.3.9

  *) Remove bogus error message when a redirect doesn't set Location.
     Instead, use an empty string to avoid coredump if the error message
     was supposed to include a location.  [Roy Fielding]

  *) Don't allow configure to include mod_auth_digest unless it is
     explicitly requested, even if the user asked for all modules.
     [Roy Fielding]

  *) Translate module names to dll names for OS/2 so that they are no more
     than 8 characters long and have an extension of "dll" instead of "so".
     [Brian Havard]

  *) Print out pointer to Rule DEV_RANDOM when truerand lib not found.
     Fix test-compile check to check for randbyte instead of trand32.
     Use ap_base64encode_binary/decode instead of copy in mod_auth_digest.c
     and tweak to make Amaya happier.  [Ronald Tschalär]

  *) Ensure that the installed expat include files are world readable,
     just like the other header files.  [Martin Kraemer]

  *) Fixed generated AddModule adjustments in APACI's `configure' script
     in order to allow (new) modules like mod_vhost_alias to be handled
     correctly (which was touched by the adjustments for mod_alias).
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) For binary builds, add -R flag to apachectl to work around the lack of
     an absolute path to the ./libexec directory where the libhttp.ep file
     is needed for SHARED_CORE architectures.  [Randy Terbush]

  *) WIN32: Create the CGI script process as DETACHED.  This may solve the
     problem observed by some Win95/98 users where they get CGI script
     output sent to the console.  [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Fix (re)naming in the uuencode/decode section. The ap/ap_
     routines are now called ap_base64* and are 'plain' (i.e., no 
     pool access or anything clever). Inside util.c the routines acting
     like pstrdup are called ap_pbase64encode() and ap_pbase64decode().
     The oddly named ap_uuencode(), ap_uudecode() are kept around for
     now but deprecated.  [dirkx]

  *) Clean up the base64 and SHA1 additions and make sure they are
     represented in the ApacheCore.def, ApacheCoreOS2.def, and httpd.exp
     files.  [Roy Fielding]

  *) WIN32: Migrate to InstallShield 5.5 and provide a bit more error
     checking.  Allow compiling on VS 6.0.  [Randy Terbush]

  *) Fixed assumption of absolute paths in binbuild.sh.  [Tony Finch]

  *) Use TestCompile to search for the truerand library (rather than blindly
     assuming its existence). If it is not found, complain (but do not
     exit - yet).  [Martin Kraemer]

  *) We forgot to add the new exported function names to
     src/support/httpd.exp.  [Bill Stoddard, Randy Terbush]

  *) Add description of -T command-line option to usage().
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) For "some" platforms (notably, EBCDIC based ones), libos needs to be
     searched only AFTER libap has been searched, because libap needs
     some symbols from libos.  [Martin Kraemer]

  *) Fix conflict with original mod_digest related to the symbol of the
     module dispatch list (which has to be unique for DSO and follow the
     usual conventions for the installation procedure).
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Add a dbm-library check for the "usual places" (-ldbm, -lndbm, -ldb)
     for other platforms as well.  [Martin Kraemer]

  *) Make ap_sha1.c compile for EBCDIC platforms: replace remaining LONG
     types by AP_LONG and replace reference to renamed variable 'ubuf'
     by 'buffer'.  [Martin Kraemer]

Changes with Apache 1.3.8 [not released]

  *) Flush the output buffer immediately after sending an error or redirect
     response, since the result may be needed by the client to abort a
     long data transfer or restart a series of pipelined requests.
     [Tom Vaughan <tvaughan@aventail.com>, Roy Fielding]

  *) PORT: Improved compilation and DSO support on Sequent DYNIX/ptx.
     [Ian Turner <iant@sequent.com>] PR#4735

  *) Local struct mmap in http_core.c conflicted with system structure
     name on DYNIX -- changed to mmap_rec.  [Roy Fielding] PR#4735

  *) Added updated mod_digest as modules/experimental/mod_auth_digest.
     [Ronald Tschalär <ronald@innovation.ch>]

  *) Fix a memory leak where the module counts were getting messed
     up across restarts.  [David Harris <dharris@drh.net>]

  *) CIDR addresses such as a.b.c.d/24 where d != 0 weren't handled
     properly in mod_access.
     ["Paul J. Reder" <rederpj@raleigh.ibm.com>] PR#4770

  *) RewriteLock/RewriteMap didn't work properly with virtual hosts.
     [Dmitry Khrustalev <dima@bog.msu.su>] PR#3874

  *) PORT: Support for compaq/tandem/com.
     [Michael Ottati <michael.ottati@compaq.com>, dirkx]

  *) Added SHA1 password encryption support to easy migration from 
     Netscape servers. See support/SHA1 for more information.
     Caused the separation of ap_md5.c into md5, sha1 and a general
     ap_checkpass.c with just a validate_passwd routine. Added a
     couple of flags to support/htpasswd. Some reuse of the to64()
     function; hence renamed to ap_to64().
     [Dirk-Willem van Gulik, Clinton Wong <clintdw@netcom.com>]

  *) Change for EBCDIC platforms (TPF and BS2000) to correctly deal
     with ASCII/EBCDIC conversions in "ident" query.
     [David McCreedy <McCreedy@us.ibm.com>]

  *) Get rid of redefinition warning on MAC_OS_X_SERVER platform.
     Change "Power Macintosh" to Power* so if uname prints "Power Book"
     we're still happy on Rhapsody platforms.  [Wilfredo Sanchez]

  *) Fix SIGSEGV on some systems because the Vary fix below included
     a call to table_do with a variable argument list that was not
     NULL terminated.  Replaced with better implementation. [Roy Fielding]

Changes with Apache 1.3.7 [not released]

  *) The "Vary" response header field is now sanitised right before
     the header is sent back to the client.  Multiple "Vary" fields
     are combined, and duplicate tokens (e.g., "Vary: host, host" or
     "Vary: host, negotiate, host, accept-language") are reduced to
     single instances.  This is a better solution than the force-no-vary
     one (which is still valid for clients that can't cope with Vary
     at all).  PR#3118 [Dean Gaudet, Roy Fielding, Ken Coar]

  *) Portability changes for BeOS. [David Reid abb37@dial.pipex.com]

  *) Link DSO's with "gcc -shared" instead of "ld -Bshareable" at 
     least on Linux and FreeBSD for now.  
     [Rasmus Lerdorf]

  *) Win32: More apache -k restart work. Restarts are now honored
     immediately and connections in the listen queue are -not- lost.
     This is made possible by the use of the WSADuplicateSocket()
     call.  The listeners are opened in the parent, duplicated, then
     the duplicates are passed to the child. The original listen sockets 
     are not closed by the parent across a restart, thus the listen queue 
     is preserved.
     [Bill Stoddard <stoddard@raleigh.ibm.com>]

  *) Fix handling of case when a client has sent "Expect: 100-continue"
     and we are going to respond with an error, but get stuck waiting to
     discard the body in the pointless hope of preserving the connection.
     [Roy Fielding, Joe Orton <jeo101@york.ac.uk>] PR#4499, PR#3806

  *) Fix 'configure' to work correctly with SysV-based versions of
     'tr' (consistent with Configure's use as well). [Jim Jagielski]

  *) apxs: Add "-S var=val" option which allows for override of CFG_*
     built-in values. Add "-e" option which works like -i but doesn't
     install the DSO; useful for editing httpd.conf with apxs. Fix
     editing code so that multiple invocations of apxs -a will not
     create duplicate LoadModule/AddModule entries; apxs can now be
     used to re- enable/disable a module.  [Wilfredo Sanchez]

  *) Win32: Update the server to use Winsock 2. Specifically, link with
     ws2_32.lib rather than wsock32.lib.  This gives us access to 
     WSADuplcateSocket() in addition to some other enhanced comm APIs.
     Win 95 users may need to update their TCP/IP stack to pick up
     Winsock 2. (See http://www.microsoft.com/windows95/downloads/)
     [Bill Stoddard stoddard@raleigh.ibm.com]

  *) Win32: Redirect CGI script stderr (script debug info) into the 
     error.log when CGI scripts fail. This makes Apache on Win32 
     behave more like Unix.      
     [Bill Stoddard stoddard@raleigh.ibm.com]

  *) Fixed `httpd' usage display: -D was missing.
     [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#4614

  *) Fix `make r' test procedure in src/regex/: ap_isprint was not found.
     [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#4561, PR#4562

  *) OS/2: Fix problem with accept lock semaphores where server would die with
     "OS2SEM: Error 105 getting accept lock. Exiting!" 
     [Brian Havard] PR#4505

  *) Add DSO support for DGUX 4.x using gcc. Tested on x86 platforms.
     [Randy Terbush <randy@covalent.net>]
 
  *) Add the new mass-vhost module (mod_vhost_alias.c) developed and
     used by Demon Internet, Ltd. [Tony Finch <fanf@demon.net>]

  *) Better GCC detection for DSO flags under Solaris 2 where the `cc' 
     command potentially _is_ GCC. [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Fix apxs build issues on AIX 
     [Rasmus Lerdorf <rasmus@raleigh.ibm.com>]

  *) DocumentRoot Checking: Under previous versions, when Apache
     first started up, it used to do a stat of each DocumentRoot to
     see if it existed and was a directory. If not, then an error
     message was printed. THIS HAS BEEN DISABLED. If DocumentRoot
     does not exist, you will get error messages in error_log. If
     the '-t' command line option is used (to check the configuration)
     the check of DocumentRoot IS performed. An additional command
     line option, '-T', has been added if you want to avoid the
     DocumentRoot check even when checking the configuration.
     [Jim Jagielski]

  *) Win32: The query switch "apache -S" didn't exit after showing the
     vhost settings. That was inconsistent with the other query functions.
     [Bill Stoddard - Fixed by Martin on Unix in 1.3.4]

  *) Win32: Changed behaviour of apache -k restart. 
     Previously, the server would drain all connections in the stack's
     listen queue before honoring the restart. On a busy server, this
     could take hours.  Now, a restart is honored almost immediately. 
     All connections in Apache's queues are handled but connections in 
     the stack's listen queue are discarded. Restart triggered by 
     MaxRequestPerChild is unchanged.
     [Bill Stoddard <stoddard@raleigh.ibm.com>]

  *) Win32: Eliminated unnecessary call to wait_for_multiple_objects in
     the accept loop. Good for a 5% performance boost. Cleaned up 
     parent/child process management code. 
     [Bill Stoddard <stoddard@raleigh.ibm.com>]

  *) Added ceiling on file size for memory mapped files.
     [John Giannandrea <jg@meer.net>] PR#4122

  *) Fix ndbm.h include problems with brain-dead glibc >= 2.1 which 
     has ndbm.h in a non-standard db1/ subdir. PR#4431, PR#4528
     [Henri Gomez <gomez@slib.fr>, Ralf S. Engelschall] 

  *) Determine AP_BYTE_ORDER for ap_config_auto.h and already
     use this at least for Expat. [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Allow .module files to specify libraries with Lib:.
     [Ben Laurie]

  *) Allow SetEnvIf[NoCase] to test environment variables as well
     as header fields and request attributes.  [Ken Coar]

  *) Fix mod_autoindex's handling of ScanHTMLTitles when file
     content-types are "text/html;parameters".  PR#4524  [Ken Coar]

  *) Remove "mxb" support from mod_negotiation -- it was a draft feature
     never accepted into any standard, and it opens up certain DoS
     attacks.  [Koen Holtman <Koen.Holtman@cern.ch>]

  *) TestCompile updated. We can now run programs and output the
     results during the Configure process. [ Jim Jagielski]

  *) The source is now quad (long long) aware as needed. Specifically,
     the Configure process determines the correct size of off_t and
     *void. When the OS/platform/compiler supports quads, ap_snprintf()
     provides for the 'q' format qualifier (if quads are not available,
     'q' is silently "demoted" to long). [Jim Jagielski]

  *) When the username or password fed to htpasswd is too long, include the
     size limit in the error message.  Also report illegal characters
     (currently only ':') in the username.  Add the size restrictions
     to the man page.  [Ken Coar]

  *) Fixed the configure --without-support option so it doesn't result in
     an infinite loop.  [Marc Slemko]

  *) Piped error logs could cause a segfault if an error occured
     during configuration after a restart.
     [Aidan Cully <aidan@panix.com>] PR#4456

  *) If a "Location" field was stored in r->err_headers_out rather
     than r->headers_out, redirect processing wouldn't find it and
     the server would core dump on ap_escape_html(NULL).  Check both
     tables and raise HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR with a log message
     if Location isn't set.  [Doug MacEachern, Ken Coar]

  *) Add RULE_EXPAT, the src/lib/ directory structure, and a modified copy
     of the Expat 1.0.2 distribution. [Greg Stein]

  *) Replace regexec() calls with calls to a new API stub function
     ap_regexec().  This solves problems with DSO modules which use the regex
     library. [Jens-Uwe Mager <jum@helios.de>, Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Add 'Request_Protocol' special keyword to mod_setenvif so that
     environment variables can be set according to the protocol version
     (e.g., HTTP/0.9 or HTTP/1.1) of the request.  [Ken Coar]

  *) Add DSO support for OpenStep (Mach 4.2) platform.
     [Ralf S. Engelschall, Rex Dieter <rdieter@math.unl.edu>] PR#3997

  *) Fix sed regex for generating ap_config_auto.h in src/Configure.
     [Jan Gallo <gallo@pvt.sk>] PR#3690, PR#4373
 
  *) Switch to /bin/sh5 in APACI on Ultrix and friends to avoid problems with
     their brain-dead /bin/sh. [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#4372

  *) Better DSO flags recognition on NetBSD platforms using ELF.
     [Todd Vierling <tv@pobox.com>] PR#4310

  *) Always log months in english format for %t in mod_log_config.
     [Petr Lampa <lampa@fee.vutbr.cz>] PR#4366, 679

  *) Support for server-parsed and multiview-determined ReadmeName and
     HeaderName files in mod_autoindex. Removed the restriction on
     "/"s in ReadmeName and HeaderName directives since the *sub_req*
     routines will deal with the access issues. (It's now possible to
     have {site|group|project|customer|...} wide readmes and headers.)
     [Raymond S Brand <rsbx@rsbx.net>, Ken Coar] PR#1574, 3026, 3529,
     3569, 4256

  *) When stat() fails, don't assume anything about the contents of
     the struct stat.  [Ed Korthof <ed@bitmechanic.com>]

  *) It's OK for a semop to return EINTR, just loop around and try
     again.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Fix configuration engine re-entrant hangups, which solve a
     handful of problems seen with mod_perl <Perl> configuration sections
     [Salvador Ortiz Garcia <sog@msg.com.mx>]

  *) Mac OS and Mac OS X Server now use the appropriate custom layout
     by default when building with APACI; allow for platform-specific
     variable defaults in configure. [Wilfredo Sanchez]

  *) Do setgid() before initgroups() in http_main; some platforms
     zap the grouplist when setgid() is called.  This was fixed in
     suexec earlier, but the main httpd code missed the change.
     [Rob Saccoccio <robs@InfiniteTechnology.com>]  PR#2579

  *) Add recognition of .tgz as a gzipped tarchive.
     [Bertrand de Singly <bertrand.de-singly@polytechnique.fr>]  PR#2364

  *) mod_include's fsize/flastmod should allow only relative paths, just
     like "include file".  [Jaroslav Benkovsky <benkovsk@pha.pvt.cz>]

  *) OS/2: Add support for building loadable modules using DLLs.
     [Brian Havard]

  *) Add iconsdir, htdocsdir, and cgidir to config.layout.
     [Wilfredo Sanchez]

  *) Fix minor but annoying bug with the test for Configuration.tmpl
     being newer than Configuration so that it is less likely to fail
     when using APACI and shadow sources. [Wilfredo Sanchez]

  *) PORT: Add initial support for Mac OS (versions 10.0 and
     greater). Use Mac OS X Server layout for now. Clean up dyld code
     in unix/os.c, and don't install the dyld error handlers, which
     are no longer needed in Mac OS. [Wilfredo Sanchez]

  *) Rename Rhapsody layout to "Mac OS X Server". Change install
     locations to appropriate ones for user-built (as opposed to
     system) installs. [Wilfredo Sanchez]

  *) Modify mod_autoindex's handling of AddDescription so that the
     behaviour matches the documentation.  [Ken Coar] PR#1898, 3072.

  *) Add functionality to the install-bindist.sh script created by
     binbuild.sh to use tar when copying distribution files to the
     serverroot. This allows upgrading an existing installation
     without nesting the new distribution in the old.

     install-bindist.sh now detects the local perl5 path to install
     apxs and dbmmanage with proper path to perl interpreter.

     Add an install-binsupport target which copies the source files
     for apxs and dbmmanage to bindist to allow these scripts to
     be properly installed relative to the destination serverroot.
     [Randy Terbush, Covalent Technologies, randy@covalent.net]

  *) Fix intermittent SEGV in ap_proxy_cache_error() in
     src/modules/proxy_util.c where a NULL filepointer and
     temporary filename were closed and unlinked.
     [Graham Leggett <minfrin@sharp.fm>,
     Tim Costello <tjcostel@socs.uts.edu.au>] PR#3178

  *) Fix inconsistent error messages reported by mod_proxy.
     [Graham Leggett <minfrin@sharp.fm>]

  *) OS/2: Fix terminating CGIs that aren't compiled by EMX GCC when a 
     connection is aborted.  [Brian Havard]

  *) Force the LANG envariable to the known state of "C" so that we
     have assurance about how string manipulators (e.g., tr) will
     function.  [Ken Coar]  PR#1630

  *) Add a directive to allow customising of the tracking cookie name.
     [Ken Coar]  PR#2921, 4303

  *) Add "force-no-vary" envariable to allow servers to work around
     clients that choke on "Vary" fields in the response header.
     [Ken Coar, Dmitry Khrustalev <dima@zippy.machaon.ru>]  PR#4118

  *) Fixed a bug in mod_dir that causes a child process will infinitely
     recurse when it attemps to handle a request for a directory wnd the
     value of the DirectoryIndex directive is a single dot. Also likely
     to happen for anyother values of DirectoryIndex that will map back
     to the same directory. The handler now only considers regular files
     as being index candidates. No PR#s found.
     [Raymond S Brand <rsbx@rsbx.net>]

  *) Ease configuration debugging by making TestCompile fall back to
     using "make" if the $MAKE variable is unset [Martin Kraemer]

  *) Fixed the ServerSignature directive to work as documented.
     [Raymond S Brand <rsbx@rsbx.net>] PR#4248

  *) Add "opt" (SysV-style) layout to config.layout. [Raymond S Brand
     <rsbx@rsbx.net>]

  *) Add APACI --without-execstrip option which can be used to disable the
     stripping of executables on installation.  This is very important for DSO
     and debugging situations. [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Add support for OS/2 (case insenstive filesystem, .exe suffix, etc)
     to APACI files and related scripts. 
     [Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes <sthoenna@efn.org>, Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#4269

  *) Fix value quoting in src/Configure script for ap_config_auto.h 
     [Paul Sutton <paul@awe.com>]

  *) Make sure RewriteLock can be used only in the global context, (i.e.
     outside of any <VirtualHost> sections) because it's a global facility of
     the rewrite engine. [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Fix the ownership delegation for proxy directory under `make install'.
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) APACI would not correctly build suexec. [Maria Verina
     <mariav@icgeb.trieste.it>] PR#4260

  *) mod_mime_magic passed only the first 4k of a file to
     uncompress/gzip, but those tools sometimes do not produce
     any output unless a sufficient portion of the compressed
     file is input.  Change to pass the entire file -- but
     only read 4k of output.

     [Dean Gaudet] PR#4225

  *) Prevent clobbering saved IFS values in APACI. [Jim Jagielski]

  *) Fix buffer overflows in ap_uuencode and ap_uudecode pointed out
     by "Peter 'Luna' Altberg <peter@altberg.nu>" and PR#3422
     [Peter 'Luna' Altberg <peter@altberg.nu>, Ronald Tschalär]

  *) Make {Set,Unset,Pass}Env per-directory instead of per-server.
     [Ben Laurie]

  *) Correct an apparent typo: on the Windows and MPE platforms, the
     htpasswd utility was limiting passwords to only 8 characters.
     [Ken Coar]

  *) EBCDIC platforms: David submitted patches for two bugs in the
     MD5 digest port for EBCDIC machines:
     a) the htdigest utility overwrote the old contents of the digest file
     b) the Content-MD5 header value (ContentDigest directive) was wrong
     when the returned file was not converted from EBCDIC, but was a
     binary (e.g., image file) in the first place.
     [David McCreedy <mccreedy@us.ibm.com>]

  *) support/htpasswd now permits the password to be specified on the
     command line with the '-b' switch.  This is useful when passwords
     need to be maintained by scripts -- particularly in the Win32
     environment.  [Ken Coar]

  *) Win32: Win32 multiple services patch. Added capability to install and
     run multiple copies of apache as individual services.

     Example 1:
     apache -n apache1 -i -f c:/httpd.conf
        Installs apache as service 'apache1' and associates c:/httpd.conf
        with that service.
     net start apache1
        Starts apache1 service.
     net stop apache1
        Stops apache1 service

     Example 2:
     apache -n apache2 -i
        Installs apache as service 'apache2'. httpd.conf is located under
        the default server root (/apache/conf/httpd.conf).
     net start apache2
        Starts apache2 service.

     Example 3:
     apache -n apache3 -i -d c:/program files/apache
        Install apache as service 'apache3' and sets server root to
        c:/program files/apache.

     Example 4:
     apache -n apache2 -k restart
        Restart apache2 service 

     [Keith Wannamaker, Ken Parzygnat, Bill Stoddard]

  *) Correct the signed/unsigned character handling for the MD5 routines;
     mismatches were causing compilation problems with gcc -pedantic and
     in the TPF cross-compilation.  [Ken Coar]

  *) OS/2: Rework CGI handling to use spawn*() instead of fork/exec, achieving
     a roughly 5 fold speed up. [Brian Havard]

  *) proxy ftp: instead of using the hardwired string "text/plain" as
     a fallback type for files served by the ftp proxy, use the
     ap_default_type() function to determine the configured type.
     This allows for special configurations like
        <Directory proxy:ftp://some.host>
        DefaultType gargle/blurb
        </Directory>
     Additionally, add the Content-Encoding: header to FTP proxy replies
     when the encoding is defined (by the AddEncoding directive).
     Because it was missing, it was almost impossible to browse compressed
     files using the FTP proxy (works now perfectly in Communicator).
     The ftp proxy now also returns the Date: and Server: header lines (if not
     much else... This code is "somewhat" broken) like normal requests do.
     [Martin Kraemer]

  *) Be more smart in APACI's configure script when determining the UID/GID
     for User/Group directives and use the determined UID/GID to initialize
     the permissions on the proxycachedir.
     [Dirk-Willem van Gulik, Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Changed the forking-prior-to-cleanup in the proxy module to first
     check wether it actually needs to collect garbage. This reduces 
     the number of fork()s from one/request to just the odd one an hour.
     [Dirk-Willem van Gulik]

  *) Added proxy, auth and header support to src/support/ab.c. Added a
     README file to src/support/
     [Dirk-Willem van Gulik]

  *) Don't hard-code the path to AWK in --shadow bootstrapping Makefile.
     [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#4050

  *) Add support for DSO module compilation on BSD/OS 3.x.
     [Randy Terbush, Covalent Technologies]

  *) Fix sed-substitutions in `make install': path elements like `httpd/conf'
     (for instance from an APACI configure --sysconfdir=/etc/httpd/conf
     option) were substituted with $(TARGET).conf, etc. Same for other strings
     with dots where the dot wasn't matched as plain text. 
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) PORT: Add support for FreeBSD 4.x [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Fix verbose output of APACI configure (option -v) 
     [Martin Kraemer, Ralf S. Engelschall]

Changes with Apache 1.3.6

  *) Removed new PassAllEnv code due to DSO problems. [Lars Eilebrecht]

Changes with Apache 1.3.5 [not released]

  *) M_INVALID needed a value within the scope of METHODS so that unknown
     methods can be access controlled.  [Roy Fielding] PR#3821

  *) Added PassAllEnv; makes server's entire environment available
     to CGIs and SSIs executed within directive's scope.  [Ken Coar]

  *) ap_uuencode() always added two trailing '='s and encoding of
     8 bit characters on a machine with signed char may produced
     incorrect results. Additionally ap_uuencode() should now
     work correctly on EBCDIC platforms.
     [Ronald Tschalär <ronald@innovation.ch>] PR#3411

  *) WIN32: Binary installer now runs the configuration DLL before
     the reboot prompt (which is only given if MSVCRT.DLL system
     DLL is new or updated). This should avoid the configuration
     directory being empty after installation. [Paul Sutton]
     PR#3767, 3800, 3827, 3850, 3900, 3953, 3988

  *) WIN32: Binary installer now creates Start menu options to start
     and stop Apache as a console application and to uninstall
     the Apache service on NT. [Paul Sutton] PR#3741

  *) WIN32: Apache.exe now contains an icon. [Paul Sutton]

  *) PORT: Switch back to using fcntl() locking on Linux -- instabilities
     have been reported with flock() locking (probably related to kernel
     version).  [Dean Gaudet] PR#2723, 3531

  *) Using APACI, the main config file (usually httpd.conf) was
     not being adjusted as $(TARGET).conf. [Wilfredo Sanchez
     <wsanchez@apple.com>]

  *) PORT: AIX does not require the SHARED_CODE "hack"
     [Ryan Bloom <rbb@raleigh.ibm.com>]

  *) Set-Cookie headers were being doubled up for some CGIs by the O(n^2)
     avoidance code added in 1.3.3.
     [Dean Gaudet, Jeff Lewis <lewis@stanford.edu>] PR#3872

  *) ap_isxdigit was somehow neglected when adding the ap_isfoo() macros
     for 8-bit safeness.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) PORT: Use -fPIC instead of -fpic on Solaris and SunOS for compiling DSOs
     because SPARCs have a small machine-specific maximum size for the Global
     Offset Table which is often exceeded when compiling one of the larger
     third-party modules with Apache. [Peter Urban <Peter.Urban@epfl.ch>] PR#3977

  *) Move the directive `ExtendedStatus' in httpd.conf-dist-win _after_ the
     DSO/DLL section because it's a directive from mod_status and isn't
     available before the DLL of mod_status is loaded.
     [Martin POESCHL <mpoeschl@gmx.net>] PR#3936

  *) SECURITY: Fix a bug in the calculation of the buffer size for the line 
     continuation facility in Apache's configuration files which could 
     lead to a buffer overflow situation.
     [Thomas Devanneaux <Thomas.Devanneaux@enst.fr>] PR#3617

  *) Make documentation and error messages of APACI's --activate-module=FILE 
     option more clear. [Jan Wolter <janc@wwnet.net>] PR#3995

  *) Fix the gcc version check (for enabling the `inline' facility) to 
     really support all future gcc versions >= 2.7 until we know more.
     [John Tobey <jtobey@banta-im.com>] PR#3983

  *) Let APACI's configure script correctly complain for unknown --enable-XXX
     and --disable-XXX options. [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#3958

  *) Link the shared core bootstrap program (``Rule SHARED_CORE=yes'') also
     against libap.a and use its ap_snprintf() instead of sprintf() to avoid
     possible buffer overflows. [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Remove no longer used non-API function ap_single_module_init().
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Add Apple's Mac OS X Server Layout "Rhapsody" to config.layout.
     [Wilfredo Sanchez]

  *) Add cgidir, htdocsdir, iconsdir variables to Makefile.tmpl in order
     to make platform installations easier.  [Wilfredo Sanchez]

  *) In configure, do not append the target name to the directory path if
     the path already contains "apache".  [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) SIGPIPE is now ignored by the server core.  The request write routines
     (ap_rputc, ap_rputs, ap_rvputs, ap_rwrite, ap_rprintf, ap_rflush) now
     correctly check for output errors and mark the connection as aborted.
     Replaced many direct (unchecked) calls to ap_b* routines with the
     analogous ap_r* calls.  [Roy Fielding]

  *) Enhanced mod_rewrite's mapfile handling: The in-core cache for text and
     DBM format mapfiles now uses a 4-way hash table with LRU functionality.
     Furthermore map lookups for non-existent keys are now cached as well.
     Additionally "txt" maps are now parsed with simple string functions
     instead of using ap_pregcomp(). As a side effect a bug that prevented
     the usage of keys containing the "," character was fixed.
     The changes drastically improve the performance when large rewrite maps
     are in use.
     [Michael van Elst <mlelstv@serpens.swb.de>, Lars Eilebrecht] PR#3160

  *) Added ap_sub_req_method_uri() for doing a subrequest with a method
     other than GET, and const'd the definition of method in request_rec.
     [Greg Stein]

  *) Use proper pid_t type for saving PIDs in alloc.c.  [John Bley]

  *) Replaced use of WIN32 define with HAVE_DRIVE_LETTERS to indicate
     when the OS allows a DOS drive letter within pathnames.  [Brian Havard]

  *) Add %V to mod_log_config, this logs the hostname according to the
     UseCanonicalName setting (this is the pre-1.3.4 behaviour of
     %v).  Useful for mass vhosting.  [Tony Finch <dot@dotat.at>]

  *) Add support for \n and \t to mod_log_config, can be used to produce
     more reliable logs with multiline entries.  [Tony Finch <dot@dotat.at>]

  *) Fixed a few compiler nits.  [John Bley <jbb6@acpub.duke.edu>]

  *) Added informative error messages for failed munmap() and fseek() calls
     in http_core.c. [John Bley, Roy Fielding]

  *) Added some informative error messages for some failed malloc()
     calls. [John Bley <jbb6@acpub.duke.edu>, Jim Jagielski]

  *) OS/2 ap_os_canonical_filename()'s behaviour is improved: ap_assert()
     is removed. This allows <Directory proxy:*> directives to work and
     prevents invalid requests from killing the process.
     [Brian Havard <brianh@kheldar.apana.org.au>]

  *) Reorganised FAQ document.
     [Joshua Slive <slive@finance.commerce.ubc.ca>] PR#2497

  *) src/support/: The ApacheBench benchmark program was overhauled by
     David N. Welton: you can now have it generate an HTML TABLE, presumably
     for integration into other HTML sources. David updated the ab man page
     as well and added some missing descriptions. Thanks!
     [David N. Welton <davidw@prosa.it>]

  *) Win32: The filename validity checker now allows filenames containing
     characters in the range 0x80 to 0xff (for example accented characters).
     [Paul Sutton] PR#3890

  *) Added conditional logging based upon environment variables to
     mod_log_config.  mod_log_referer and mod_log_agent
     are now deprecated.  [Ken Coar]

  *) Allow apache acting as a proxy server to relay the real
     reason of a failure to a client rather than the "internal
     server error" it does currently. The general exposure mechanism
     can be triggered by any module by setting the "verbose-error-to"
     note to "*"; this allows more than just proxy errors to be exposed.
     [Cliff Skolnick, Roy Fielding, Martin Kraemer] Related to PR#3455, 4086

  *) Moved man pages for ab and apachectrl to section 8.
     [Wilfredo Sanchez, Roy Fielding]

  *) Added -S option to install.sh so that options can be passed to
     strip on some platforms. [Ralf S. Engelschall, Wilfredo Sanchez]

  *) Tweak modules Makefile generated by Configure so that it handles
     the test case of no modules being selected. [chaz@reliant.com]

  *) Added a <LimitExcept method ...> sectioning directive that allows
     the user to assign authentication control to any HTTP method that
     is *not* given in the argument list; i.e., the logical negation
     of the <Limit> directive.  This is particularly useful for controlling
     access on methods unknown to the Apache core, but perhaps known by
     some module or CGI script. [Roy Fielding, Tony Finch]

  *) Prevent apachectl from complaining if the PIDFILE exists but
     does not contain a process id, as might occur if the server is
     being rapidly restarted. [Wilfredo Sanchez]

  *) Win32: Add global symbols missing from ApacheCore.def. [Carl Olsen]

  *) Entity tag comparisons for If-Match and If-None-Match were not being
     performed correctly -- weak tags might cause false positives.  Also,
     strong comparison wasn't properly enforced in all cases.
     [Roy Fielding, Ken Coar, Dean Gaudet] PR#2065, 3657

  *) OS/2: Supply OS/2 error code instead of errno on semaphore errors.
     [Brian Havard]

  *) Work around a bug in Lynx regarding its sending "Negotiate: trans"
     even though it doesn't understand TCN.  [Koen Holtman, Roy Fielding]

  *) Added ap_size_list_item(), ap_get_list_item(), and ap_find_list_item()
     to util.c for parsing an HTTP header field value to extract the next
     list item, taking into account the possible presence of nested comments,
     quoted-pairs, and quoted-strings. ap_get_list_item() also removes
     insignificant whitespace and lowercases non-quoted tokens.
     [Roy Fielding] PR#2065

  *) proxy: The various calls to ap_proxyerror() can return HTTP/1.1 status
     code different from 500. This allows the proxy to, e.g., return
     "403 Forbidden" for ProxyBlock'ed URL's. [Martin Kraemer] Related to PR#3455

  *) Fix ordering of language variants for the case where the traditional
     negotiation algorithm is being used with multiple language variants
     and no Accept-Language. [James Treacy <treacy@debian.org>] PR#3299, 3688

  *) Do not round the TCN quality calculation to 5 decimal places,
     unlike RFC 2296, because the calculation might need 12 decimal places
     to get the right result.  [Roy Fielding]

  *) Remove unused code to disable transparent negotiation when
     negotiating on encoding only, as we now handle encoding too
     (though this is nonstandard for TCN), remove charset=ISO-8859-1
     fiddle from the fiddle-averse RVSA comparison, and fix bugs in
     some debugging statements within mod_negotiation. [Koen Holtman]

  *) Fixed a rare memory corruption possibility in mod_dir if the index
     file is negotiable and no acceptable variant can be found.
     [Dean Gaudet, Roy Fielding, Martin Kraemer]

  *) Win32: Add new config directive, ScriptInterpreterSource, to enable
     searching the Win32 registry for script interpreters.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Win32: The compiled-in default filename for the error log is now
     error.log, which matches the default in the distributed httpd.conf.
     [Paul Sutton]

  *) Win32: Any error messages from -i or -u command line options are now
     displayed on the console output rather than sent to the error log.
     Also the "Running Apache..." message is not output unless Apache is
     going to serve requests. [Paul Sutton]

  *) Rework the MD5 authentication scheme to use FreeBSD's algorithm,
     and use a private significator ('$apr1$') to mark passwords as
     being smashed with our own algorithm.  Also abstract the password
     checking into a new ap_validate_password() routine.  [Ken Coar]

  *) Win32: The filename validity checker now allows "COM" but refuses 
     access to "COM1" through "COM4". This allows filenames such
     as "com.name" to be served. [Paul Sutton] PR#3769.

  *) BS2000: Adapt to the new ufork() system call interface which will
     make subtasking easier on the OSD/POSIX mainframe environment.
     [Martin Kraemer]

  *) Add a compatibility define for escape_uri() -> ap_escape_uri() to
     ap_compat.h. [David White <david@persimmon.com>] PR#3725

  *) Make NDBM file suffix determination for mod_rewrite more accurate, i.e.
     use `.db' instead of `.pag' not only for FreeBSD, but also when
     the NDBM library looks like Berkeley-DB based.
     [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#3773

  *) Add ability to handle DES or MD5 authentication passwords.
     [Ryan Bloom <rbb@Raleigh.IBM.Com>]

  *) Fix O(n^2) memory consumption in mod_speling.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) SECURITY: Avoid some buffer overflow problems when escaping
     quoted strings.  (This overflow was on the heap and we believe
     impossible to exploit.)  [Rick Perry <perry@ece.vill.edu>]

  *) Let src/Configure be aware of CFLAGS options starting with plus
     signs as it's the case for the HP/UX compiler.
     [Doug Yatcilla <yatcilda@umdnj.edu>] PR#3681

  *) Remove the hard-wire of TAR=tar (we now check for gtar and gnutar first)
     and check to see if the tar we wind up with supports '-h'.
     [Jim Jagielski] PR#3671

  *) A consistent and conservative style for all shell scripts has been
     implemented. Basically, all shell string tests use the traditional
     hack of 'if [ "x$var" != "x" ]' or 'if [ "x$var" = "xstring" ]'
     to protect against bare null variable strings (ie: wrapping both
     sides with double quotes and prepending 'x'). 'x' was chosen
     because it's more universal and hopefully easier for old shell
     prgrammers, as well as being easier to search for in 'vi' (/x\$) :)
     [Jim Jagielski]

  *) The status module now prints out both the main server generation as
     well as the generation of each process. Also, the vhost info is
     printed with '?notable'. [Jim Jagielski]

  *) Move src/main/md5c.c to src/ap/ap_md5c.c; it's httpd-neutral
     and this makes its functions available to things in src/support.
     [Ken Coar]

Changes with Apache 1.3.4

  *) Renamed macros status_drops_connection to ap_status_drops_connection
     and vestigial scan_script_header to ap_scan_script_header_err,
     mostly for aesthetic reasons. [Roy Fielding]

  *) The query switch "httpd -S" didn't exit after showing the
     vhost settings. That was inconsistent with the other query functions.
     [Martin Kraemer]

  *) Moved the MODULE_MAGIC_COOKIE from before the versions and
     filename to the end of the STANDARD_MODULE_STUFF.  Its
     presence at the beginning prevented reporting of the filename
     for modules compiled before 1 January 1999.  [Ken Coar]

  *) SECURITY: ap_os_is_filename_valid() has been added to Win32
     to detect and prevent access to special DOS device file names.
     [Paul Sutton, Ken Parzygnat]
     
  *) WIN32: Created new makefiles Makefile_win32.txt (normal build)
     and Makefile_win32_debug.txt (debug build) that work on Win95.
     Run each of the following from the src directory:
        nmake /f Makefile_win32.txt           # compiles normal build
        nmake /f Makefile_win32.txt install   # compiles and installs
        nmake /f Makefile_win32.txt clean     # removes compiled junk
        nmake /f Makefile_win32_debug.txt     # compiles debug build
        nmake /f Makefile_win32_debug.txt install
        nmake /f Makefile_win32_debug.txt clean
     [Roy Fielding]

  *) Added binbuild.sh and findprg.sh helpers to make it easier for us
     to build binary distributions. [Lars Eilebrecht]

  *) IndexOptions SuppressColumnSorting only turned off making
     the column headers anchors; you could still change the display
     order by manually adding a '?N=A' or similar query string to the
     URL.  Now SuppressColumnSorting locks in the sort order so
     it can't be overridden this way.  [Ken Coar]

  *) Added IndexOrderDefault directive to supply a default sort order
     for FancyIndexed directory listings.  [Ken Coar] PR#1699

  *) Change the ap_assert macro to a variant that works on all platforms.
     [Richard Prinz <richard.prinz@cso.net>] PR#2575

  *) Make sure under ELF-based NetBSD (now) and OpenBSD (future) we don't
     search for an underscore on dlsym() (as it's already the case
     for FreeBSD 3.0). [Todd Vierling <tv@pobox.com>] PR#2462
  
  *) Small fix for mod_env.html: The module was documented as to be _not_
     compiled into Apache per default, although it _IS_ compiled into 
     Apache per default. [Sim Harbert <sim@mindspring.com>] PR#3572

  *) Instead of fixing a bug in the generation procedure for config.status (a
     backslash was missing) we remove the bug together with it's complete
     context because the special cases of the past can now no longer occur
     because of the recent magic for the --with-layout default.

  *) Make top-level Makefile aware of a parallel build procedures (make -j) by
     making sure the src/support/ tools are _forced_ to be build last (they
     depend on other libraries).
     [Markus Theissinger <markus.theissinger@gmx.de>]

  *) Fix installation procedure: Now that os-inline.c is actually used (a
     recently fixed bug prevented this) we need to also install os-include.c
     in addition to os.h into the PREFIX/include/ location or building of
     module DSOs with APXS fails. [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#3527

  *) Added MODULE_MAGIC_COOKIE as the first field in a module structure to
     allow us to distinguish between a garbled DSO (or even a file which isn't
     an Apache module DSO at all) and a DSO which doesn't match the current
     Apache API. [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#3152
 
  *) Two minor enhancements to mod_rewrite: First RewriteRule now also
     supports the ``nocase|NC'' flag (as RewriteCond already does for ages) to
     match case insensitive (this especially avoids nasty patterns like
     `[tT][eE][sS][tT]'). Second two additional internal map functions
     `escape' and `unescape' were added which can be used to escape/unescape
     to/from hex-encodings in URLs parts (this is especially useful in
     combination with map lookups). 
     [Magnus Bodin, Ian Kallen, Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Renamed the macro escape_uri() to ap_escape_uri() which was
     forgotten (because it was a macro) in the symbol renaming process.
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Fix some inconsistencies related to the scopes of directives. The only
     user visible change is that the directives `UseCanonicalName' and
     `ContentDigest' now use the (more correct) `Options' scope instead of
     (less correct) `AuthConfig' scope.  [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Using DSO, the Server token was being mangled. Specifically, the
     module's token was being added first before the Apache token. This
     has been fixed. [Jim Jagielski]

  *) Major overhaul of mod_negotiation.c, part 2.
     - properly handle "identity" within Accept-Encoding.
     - allow encoded variants in RVSA negotiation and let them appear in
       the Alternates field using the non-standard "encoding" tag-list.
     - fixed both negotiation algorithms so that an explicitly accepted
       encoding is preferred over no encoding if "identity" is not
       included within Accept-Encoding.
     - added ap_array_pstrcat() to alloc.c for efficient concatenation
       of large substring sequences.
     - replaced O(n^2) memory hogs in mod_negotiation with ap_array_pstrcat.
     [Roy Fielding]

  *) Major overhaul of mod_negotiation.c, part 1.
     - cleanups to mod_negotiation comments and code structure
     - made compliant with HTTP/1.1 proposed standard (rfc2068) and added
       support for everything in the upcoming HTTP/1.1
       revision (draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-rev-06.txt).
         - language tag matching also handles tags with more than 2
           levels like x-y-z
         - empty Accept, Accept-Language, Accept-Charset headers are
           processed correctly; previously an empty header would make all
           values acceptable instead of unacceptable.
         - allowed for q values in Accept-Encoding
     - added support for transparent content negotiation (rfc2295 and
       rfc2296) (though we do not implement all features in these drafts,
       e.g. no feature negotiation).  Removed old experimental version.
     - implemented 'structured entity tags' for better cache correctness
       (structured entity tags ensure that caches which can deal with Vary
       will (eventually) be updated if the set of variants on the server
       is changed)
         - this involved adding a vlist_validator element to request_rec
         - this involved adding the ap_make_etag() function to the global API
     - modified guessing of charsets used by Apache negotiation algorithm 
       to guess 'no charset' if the variant is not a text/* type
     - added code to sort multiviews variants into a canonical order so that
       negotiation results are consistent across backup/restores and mirrors
     - removed possibility of a type map file resolving to another type map
       file as its best variant

  *) Configure was initializing the variables $OSDIR, $INCDIR and $SHELL

     This improves the make environment available to TestCompile and

  *) The hashbang emulation code in ap_execve.c would interpret
     #!/hashbang/scripts correctly, but failed to fall back to a
     standard shell for scripts which did NOT start with #!
     Now SHELL_PATH is started in these cases. [Martin Kraemer]

  *) PORT: Added the Cyberguard V2 port [Richard Stagg <stagg@lentil.org>]
     PR#3336

  *) Update APXS manual page: some -q option arguments were missing
     and another was incorrect. [Mark Anderson <mda@discerning.com>] PR#3553

  *) Cleanup the command line options: `-?' was documented to show
     the usage list but does it with an error because `?' is not a valid
     command. OTOH a lot of users expect `-h' to print such a usage list and
     instead are annoyed for ages by our huge unreadable list of directives.
     So we now changed the command line options this way:
     1. `-L' => `-R' 
        Intent: we need `-L' to be free, and `-R' for the DSO run-time path is
        very similar to the popular linker option.
     2. `-h' => `-L'
        Intent: while -l gives the small list of modules, -L now gives the
        large list of directives implemented by these modules.  This is also
        consistent with -v (short version info) and -V (large version info).
     3. `-?' => `-h' 
        Intent: it's now the expected option ;-)
     The manual page was adjusted accordingly.

  *) Fixed problem of fclose() on an unopened file in suexec if LOG_EXEC
     wasn't defined.  [Rick Franchuk <rickf@transpect.net>]

  *) Removed recently introduced bugs and disfigurements in APACI:
     o fixed argument line processing: using $args was broken: It was not
       initialized and using args="$args $apc_option" and even args="$args
       \"$apc_option\"" fails in the second processing round for any arguments
       containing whitespaces. The only correct way is to use the construct
       "$@" (but not possible here) or iterate _both_ times over the implicit
       argument line (no argument to for-loop) which is what we now use.
     o make --with-layout=Apache the default without creating
       redundancy (copying the --with-layout block in the argument parsing
       loop).  We achieve this by using the "$@" construct together with the
       `set' command to prepend --with-layout=Apache to the command line in
       case --with-layout is not used.
     o fixed auto-suffix handling now that config.layout exists.
       Paths which are auto-suffixed are marked with a trailing plus sign in
       config.layout and every path now can be marked this way (not only the
       four paths for which we do it currently).  Additionally the suffix is
       no longer a static one. Instead it's now `/<target>' where <target> is
       the argument of the --target option or per default `httpd'.
     o allow also tabs (and only spaces) where we match whitespaces
     o various fixes and cleanups related to used shell coding style
     o made Jim happy by replacing `Written by' with `Initially written by' ;-)
     o trimmed output of --help to fit into 80 columns
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Added two new core API functions, ap_single_module_configure() and
     ap_single_module_init(), which are now used by mod_so to configure a module

     of ap_config.h that would skip several defines if DEFAULT_GROUP
     was overridden. [Roy Fielding]

  *) PORT: The I86 version of DGUX has support for strncasecmp and 
     strcasecmp, so allow it in ap_config.h. [Amiel Lee Yee] PR#3247

  *) Fix ordering of definitions in ap_config.h so that ap_inline is
     defined before it might be used. [Victor Khimenko]

  *) PORT: Add Dynamic Shared Object (DSO) support for BSDI (v4.0).
     [Tom Serkowski <tks@bsdi.com>] PR#3453

  *) Make generation of src/Configuration.apaci more robust: It failed to
     differenciate between modules when one module name was a postfix of
     another (e.g. cgi vs. fastcgi). We now check for mod_XXX, libXXX and even
     just XXX (think about totally non-standard names like "apache_ssl", too).
     [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#3380

  *) In src/Configure remove the SERVER_SUBVERSION support (already deprecated
     since 1.3b7) and make whitespace handling more robust (it failed horrible
     when whitespaces were present in the arguments of -D options).
     [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#3240

  *) Add APACI --shadow=DIR variant (in addition to --shadow). This now first
     creates an external package shadow tree in DIR before the local build
     shadow tree is generated under DIR. This way one can have the extracted
     Apache distribution tree read-only on NFS or CDROM and still build Apache
     from these sources. An automatically triggered VPATH-like mechanism is
     provided through the TOP variable, too.

  *) Allow special options -Wc,xxx and -Wl,xxx on APXS compile/link command.
     They can occur multiple times and their arguments (`xxx') are passed AS

  *) Fixed possible (but harmless in practice) bug in the DBM lookup
     procedure of mod_rewrite: very long keys were truncated.
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Added a generic --with-layout=[FILE:]ID option. ID here is a layout
     identifier, currently "Apache" and "GNU" are pre-defined in the file
     config.layout.  Custom layouts are possible by using FILE:ID as the
     argument where the layout ID is taken from FILE.

     The config.layout file consists of <Layout ID>..</Layout> sections
     where inside those sections "path_variable: path_value" pairs can be
     specified. These lines are converted to path_variable='path_value'.

  *) Add a DefaultLanguage directive so that files missing a language
     extension (e.g., .fr, .de) can be labelled as being some other
     default language. DefaultLanguage can appear in <Directory> and 
     <Files> containers as well as .htaccess files.  [Paul Sutton]
     PR#1180

  *) Fix TARGET configuration when configuring and installing using
     APACI configure. TARGET now defines the basename of the configuration
     file, startup script, manual page, etc. log_error_core() now reports

     with --target=TARGET parameter passed to APACI configure.

     in the Configuration[.apaci] file. Two special and important variants are
     supported for the option argument: first BEGIN:foo which permutes module
     mod_foo with the begin of the module list, i.e. it `moves' the module to
     the begin of the list (gives it lowest priority).  And second foo:END
     which permutes mod_foo with the end of the module list, i.e. it `moves'
     the module to the end of the list (gives it highest priority).

  *) Win32 name canonicalisation could end up using the server's
     working directory to fill in some blanks.  [Ken Parzygnat
     <kparz@raleigh.ibm.com>] PR#3001

  *) Correct invalid assumption by ap_sub_req_lookup_file() that all
     absolute paths begin with "/" -- because they don't on Win32.
     [Ken Parzygnat <kparz@raleigh.ibm.com>] PR#2976, 3074

  *) Add [REDIRECT_]VARIANTS environment variable to mod_speling
     so that ErrorDocument 300 processors can reformat the list
     if desired.  [Ken Coar] PR#2859

  *) Add +/- incremental prefixes to IndexOptions keywords, and

  *) Reconstructed the loop through multiple htaccess file names so
     that missing files are not confused with unreadable files.
     [Roy Fielding]

  *) The ap_pfopen and ap_pfdopen routines were failing to protect the
     errno on an error, which leads to one error being mistaken for
     another when reading non-existent .htaccess files.
     [Jim Jagielski]

  *) OS/2: The new header tests get things right, need to update
     ap_config.h.  [Brian Havard]

Changes with Apache 1.3.2

  *) Fix bug in ap_remove_module(), which caused problems for dso's 
     who were the top_module.  [Doug MacEachern]

  *) Add support for Berkeley-DB/2.x (in addition to Berkeley-DB/1.x) to
     mod_auth_db to both be friendly to users who wants to use this version
     and to avoid problems under platforms where only version 2.x is present.
     [Dan Jacobowitz <drow@false.org>, Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) When using ap_log_rerror(), make the error message available to the
     *ERROR_NOTES envariables by default.  [Ken Coar]

  *) BS2000 platform only: get rid of the nasty BS2000AuthFile.
     You now must define a BS2000Account name for the server User.
     This has fewer security implications than the old approach.
     [Martin Kraemer]

  *) Fix SHARED_CORE feature for HPUX platform: We now use extension `.sl'
     instead of `.so' and `SHLIB_PATH' instead of `LD_LIBRARY_PATH' on this
     platform to make the braindead HPUX linker happy. Notice, for the module
     DSOs we don't have to use this, because these are loaded manually (and
     not via HPUX' dld). [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2905, PR#2968

  *) Remove 64 thread limit on Win32.
     [Bill Stoddard <stoddard@raleigh.ibm.com>]

  *) Remove redundant substitutions in top-level Makefile.tmpl.
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Fix APACI's `Group' configuration adjustment - especially for Linux
     platforms where `nogroup' exists in /etc/group. [Ralf S. Engelschall]
 
  *) Make PrintPath work generically instead of having one version
     strictly for OS/2. [Jim Jagielski, Brian Havard]

  *) Fix the recently introduced C header file checking: We now use the C
     pre-processor pass only (and no longer the complete compiler pass) to
     determine whether a C header file exists or not. Because only this way
     we're safe against inter-header dependencies (which caused horrible
     portability problems). The only drawback is that we now have a CPP
     configuration variable which has to be determined first (we do a similar
     approach as GNU Autoconf does here). When all fails the user still has
     the possibility to override it manually via APACI or src/Configuration.
     As a fallback for the header check itself we can directly check the
     existance of the file under /usr/include, too.
     [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2777

  *) PORT: Added RHAPSODY (Mac OS X Server) support. MAP_TMPFILE defined
     as an alternate mechanism for mmap'd shared memory for RHAPSODY.
     ap_private_extern defined to hide symbols that conflict with loaded
     dynamic libraries on the NEXT and RHAPSODY platforms.

  *) Fix documentation of ProxyPass/ProxyPassReverse according to the
     trailing slash problem. [Jon Drukman <jsd@gamespot.com>] PR#2933
  
  *) Remove `-msym' option from LDFLAGS_SHLIB for the Digital UNIX (OSF/1)
     platform, because it's only supported under version 4.0 and higher. But
     because our GuessOS is still unaware of Digital UNIX versions and the
     -msym is just to optimize the DSO statup time a little bit it's safe and
     best when we leave it out now.  [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2969

  *) Fix the ap_log_error_old(), ap_log_unixerr() and ap_log_printf()
     functions: First all three functions no longer fail on strings containing
     "%" chars and second ap_log_printf() no longer does a double-formatting
     (instead it directly passes through the message to be formatted to the
     real internal formatting function). [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2941

  *) Allow "Include" directives anywhere in the server config
     files (but not .htaccess files).  [Ken Coar] PR#2727

  *) The proxy was refusing to serve CONNECT requests except to
     port 443 (https://) and 563 (snews://). The new AllowCONNECT
     directive allows the configuration of the ports to which a
     CONNECT is allowed.  [Sameer Parekh, Martin Kraemer]

  *) mod_expires will now act on content that is not sent from a file
     on disk.  Previously it would never add an Expires: header to
     any response that did not come from a file on disk; the only
     case where it still doesn't (and can't) add one for that type of 
     content is if you are using a modification date based setting.  
     [Marc Slemko, Paul Phillips <paulp@go2net.com>]

  *) Problems encountered during .htaccess parsing or CGI execution
     that lead to a "500 Server Error" condition now provide explanatory
     text (in the *ERROR_NOTES envariable) to ErrorDocument 500 scripts.
     [Ken Coar] PR#1291

  *) Add NameWidth keyword to IndexOptions directive so that the
     width of the filename column is customisable.  [Ken Coar, Dean Gaudet]
     PR#1949, 2324.

  *) Recognize lowercase _and_ uppercase `uname' results under
     SCO OpenServer. [David Coelho <drc@ppt.com>]

  *) As duplicate "HTTP/1.0 200 OK" lines within the header seem to be
     a common problem of (mis-administrated?) IIS servers, make the apache
     proxy immune to these errors (and ignore the duplicates, but log
     the fact to error_log). [Martin Kraemer], after the proposal in PR#2914 
     
  *) The <IfModule and <IfDefine block starting directives now only
     allow exactly one argument. Previously, the optional negation
     character '!' could be separated by whitespace without a syntax
     error being reported, albeit defeating the IfModule functionality
     (enclosed directives would ALWAYS be executed). By using the
     stricter syntax, these hard-to-track errors can be avoided.
     [Martin Kraemer]

  *) Simplify handling of IndexOptions in mod_autoindex -- and BTW
     cause the standalone FancyIndexing directive to logically OR
     into any existing IndexOptions settings rather than wiping
     them out.  [Ken Coar]

  *) Changes in ftp proxy: make URL parsing simpler by using the
     parsed_uri stuff.
     + Add display of the "current directory" in cases where it's
     different from the supplied path (e.g., ftp://user@host/ lives
     in /home/user, not in /, therefore clicking on "../" in the
     starting directory might send us to /home/).
     + When ftp login fails, (esp. when a user name was part of the
     URL already), we now return [401 Unauthorized ] to allow the
     browser to pop up an authorization dialog. This makes passwords
     slightly less visible (they don't appear in the regular log files)
     and implements a functionality that other www proxy servers
     already offered.
     [Martin Kraemer]

  *) Triggered by the recent "Via:" header changes, the proxy module would
     dump core for replies with invalid headers (e.g., duplicate
     "HTTP/1.0 200 OK" lines). These errors are now logged and the
     core dump is avoided. Also, broken replies are not cached.
     [Martin Kraemer] PR#2914

  *) new `GprofDir' directive when compiled with -DGPROF, where gprof can
     plop gmon.out profile data for each child [Doug MacEachern]
   
  *) Use the construct ``"$@"'' instead of ``$*'' in the generated
     config.status script to be immune against arguments with whitespaces.
     [Yves Arrouye <yves@apple.com>] PR#2866

  *) Replace the inlined information grabbing stuff for the configuration
     adjustment feature (no --without-confadjust) with calls to a new helper
     script `buildinfo.sh' which is both more flexible and already proofed to
     be more robust against platform differences. This mainly fixes the
     recently occured ``sed: command garbled: ...'' problems.
     [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2776, PR#2848

  *) Make ab.c again pass ``gcc -Wall -Wshadow -Wpointer-arith -Wcast-align
     -Wmissing-prototypes -Wmissing-declarations -Wnested-externs -Winline''
     without complains after we recently added the POST feature.
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Renamed is_HTTP_xxx() macros to ap_is_HTTP_xxx() name. They are used inside
     modules as API functions and we forgot them at the big symbol renaming.
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Remove bad reference to non-existing SERVER_VERSION in mod_rewrite.html
     [Youichirou Koga <y-koga@jp.FreeBSD.ORG>] PR#2895

  *) Dynamically size the filename column of mod_autoindex output.
     [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Add the ability to do POST requests to the ab benchmarking tool.
     [Kurt Sussman <kls@best.com>] PR#2871

  *) Bump up MAX_ENV_FLAGS in mod_rewrite.h from the too conservatice limit of
     5 to 10 because there are some users out there who always have 5 to 8
     variables in one RewriteRule and had to patch mod_rewrite.h for every
     release. So 15 should be now more than enough, even for them. (I never
     needed more than 4 in my RewriteRules ;-)
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Make the proxy generate and understand Via: headers
     [Martin Kraemer]

  *) Change the proxy to use tables instead of array_headers for
     the header lines. [Martin Kraemer]

  *) Make sure the config.status file is not overridden when just
     ``configure --help'' is used. [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2844

  *) Split MODULE_MAGIC_NUMBER into _MAJOR/_MINOR numbers. This should
     provide a way to trace API changes that add functionality but do
     not create a compatibility issue for precompiled modules, etc.
     See include/ap_mmn.h for more details.  [Randy Terbush]

  *) Fix suexec installation under `make install root=xxx' situation.
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Extend the output of the -V switch to include the paths of all
     compiled-in configuration files, if they were overridden at
     compile time, for least astonishment of the user.
     [Martin Kraemer]

  *) When READing a request in ExtendedStatus mode, the "old"
     vhost, request and client information is not displayed.
     [Jim Jagielski]

  *) STATUS is no longer available. Full status information now
     run-time configurable using the ExtendedStatus directive.
     [Jim Jagielski]

  *) SECURITY: Eliminate O(n^2) space DoS attacks (and other O(n^2)
     cpu time attacks) in header parsing.  Add ap_overlap_tables(),
     a function which can be used to perform bulk update operations
     on tables in a more efficient manner.  CAN-1999-1199 (cve.mitre.org)
     [Dean Gaudet]

  *) SECURITY: Added compile-time and configurable limits for
     various aspects of reading a client request to avoid some simple
     denial of service attacks, including limits on maximum request-line
     size (LimitRequestLine), number of header fields (LimitRequestFields),
     and size of any one header field (LimitRequestFieldsize).  Also added
     a configurable directive LimitRequestBody for limiting the size of the
     request message body.  [Roy Fielding]

  *) Make status module aware of DNS and logging states, even if
     STATUS not defined.  [Jim Jagielski]

  *) Fix a problem with the new OS/2 mutexes.  [Brian Havard]

  *) Enhance mod_speling so that CheckSpelling can be used in
     <Directory> containers and .htaccess files.  [Ken Coar]

  *) API: new ap_custom_response() function for hooking into the
     ErrorDocument mechanism at runtime [Doug MacEachern]

  *) API: new ap_uuencode() function [Doug MacEachern]

  *) API: scan_script_header_err_core() now "public" and renamed
     ap_scan_script_header_err_core() [Doug MacEachern]

  *) The 'status' module will now show the process pid's and their
     state even without full STATUS accounting. [Jim Jagielski]

  *) Restore the client IP address to the error log messages, this
     was lost during the transition from 1.2 to 1.3.  Add a new
     function ap_log_rerror() which takes a request_rec * and
     formats it appropriately.  [Dean Gaudet] PR#2661

  *) Cure ap_cfg_getline() of its nasty habit of compressing internal
     whitespace in input lines -- including within quoted strings.
     [Ken Coar]
     but leading and trailing whitespace should continue to be
     stripped [Martin Kraemer]

  *) Cleanup of the PrintPath/PrintPathOS2 helper functions. Avoid
     the ugly use of an env. variable and use command-line args for
     alternate $PATH. Make more like advanced 'type's as well.
     [Jim Jagielski]

  *) The IRIXN32 Rule was being ignored. Configure now correctly adds
     -n32 only if IRIXN32 says to. [Jim Jagielski, Alain St-Denis
     <alain.st-denis@ec.gc.ca>] PR#2736

  *) Clean up a warning in mod_proxy. [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Renamed __EMX__ (internal define of the gcc port under OS/2) to OS2
     following the same idea as "MSVC vs WIN32". Additionally the src/os/emx/
     directory was renamed to src/os/os2/ for consistency.
     [Brian Havard, Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Add new Rule SHARED_CHAIN which can be used to enable linking of DSO
     files (here modules) against other DSO files (here shared libraries).
     This is done by determining a subset of LIBS which can be safely used for
     linking the DSOs, i.e. PIC libs and shared libs.  Currently the rule is
     disabled for all platforms to avoid problems with this (experimental)
     rule. But we provide it now for those people how ran into problems and
     want to came out by forcing linking against DSOs.
     [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2587

  *) Fix suEXEC start message: Has to be of `notice' level to really get
     printed together with the standard startup message because the `notice'
     level is handled special inside ap_log_error() for startup messages.
     [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2761 PR#2761 PR#2765

  *) Add correct `model' MIME types from RFC2077 to mime.types file.
     [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2732

  *) Fixed examples in mod_rewrite.html document. 
     [Youichirou Koga <y-koga@jp.FreeBSD.org>, Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2756

  *) Allow ap_read_request errors to propagate through the normal request
     handling loop so that the connection can be properly closed with
     lingering_close, thus avoiding a potential TCP reset that would
     cause the client to miss the HTTP error response.  [Roy Fielding]

  *) One more portability fix for APACI shadow tree support: Swap order of awk
     and sed in top-level configure script to avoid sed fails on some
     platforms (for instance SunOS 4.1.3 and NCR SysV) because of the
     non-newline-termined output of Awk. [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2729

  *) PORT: NEC EWS4800 support.
     [MATSUURA Takanori <t-matsuu@protein.osaka-u.ac.jp>]

  *) Fix a segfault in the proxy on OS/2.  [Brian Havard]

  *) Fix Win32 part of ap_spawn_child() by providing a reasonable child_info
     structure instead of just NULL. This fixes at least the RewriteMap
     programs under Win32. [Marco De Michele <mdemichele@tin.it>] PR#2483

  *) Add workaround to top-level `configure' script for brain dead 
     `echo' commands which interpet escape sequences per default.
     [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2654

  *) Make sure that the path to the Perl interpreter is correctly
     adjusted under `make install' also for the printenv CGI script.
     [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2595
 
  *) Update the mod_rewrite.html document to correctly reflect the situation
     of the `proxy' (`[P]') feature. [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2679

  *) Fix `install-includes' sub-target of `install' target in top-level
     Makefile.tmpl: The umask+cp approach didn't work as expected (especially
     for users which extracted the distribution under 'umask 077'), so replace
     it by an explicit cp+chmod approach.
     [Richard Lloyd, Curt Sampson, Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2656 PR#2626
 
  *) Fix `distclean' and `clean' targets in src/Makefile.tmpl to have same
     behavior and to cleanup correctly even under enabled SHARED_CORE rule.
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Use a more straight forward and thus less problematic Sed command in
     src/helper/mkdir.sh script.  [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Make sure the `configure' scripts doesn't fail when trying to guess the
     domainname of the machine and there are multiple `domainname' and
     `search' entries in /etc/resolv.conf.
     [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2710

  *) Add note about the SHARED_CORE requirement on some platforms also to the
     INSTALL file because a lot of users don't read htdocs/manual/dso.html
     first. [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2701

  *) Fix document "hyperlink" for dso.html in src/Configuration.tmpl
     [Knut A.Syed <Knut.Syed@nhh.no>] PR#2674

  *) Modify mod_rewrite to update the Vary response field if the URL rewriting
     engine does any manipulations or decisions based upon request fields. 
     [Ken Coar] PR#1644

  *) Document the special APACI behavior for installation paths where
     ``/apache'' is appended to paths under some (well defined, of course)
     situations to prevent pollution of system locations with Apache files.
     [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2660

  *) Fixed problem with buffered response message not being sent for
     the read_request error conditions of URI-too-long (414) and
     malformed header fields (400).  [Roy Fielding] PR#2646

  *) Add support for the Max-Forwards: header line required by RFC2068 for
     the TRACE method. This allows apache to TRACE along a chain of proxies
     up to a predetermined depth. [Martin Kraemer]

  *) Fix SHARED_CORE rule: The CFLAGS_SHLIB variable is no longer doubled
     (compilers complained) and the .so.V.R.P filename extension was adjusted
     to correctly reflect the 1.3.2 version.
     [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2644

  *) SECURITY: Plug "..." and other canonicalization holes under OS/2.
     [Brian Havard]
  
  *) PORT: implement serialized accepts for OS/2.  [Brian Havard]

  *) mod_include had problems with the fsize and flastmod directives
     under WIN32.  Fix also avoids the minor security hole of using
     ".." paths for fsize and flastmod.
     [Manoj Kasichainula <manojk@raleigh.ibm.com>] PR#2355

  *) Fixed some Makefile dependency problems.  [Dean Gaudet]

Changes with Apache 1.3.1

  *) Disable the incorrect entry for application/msword in the 
     mod_mime_magic "magic" file because it also matches other Office
     documents.  [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2608

  *) Fix broken RANLIB handling in src/Configure (the entry from
     src/Configuration.tmpl was ignored) and additionally force RANLIB to
     /bin/true under HP/UX where ranlib exists but is deprecated.
     [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2627
     
  *) 'apachectl status' failed on some systems.
     [Steve VanDevender <stevev@darkwing.uoregon.edu>, Lars Eilebrecht] PR#2613

  *) Add new flags for ap_unparse_uri_components() to make it generate
     the scheme://sitepart string only, or to omit the query string.
     [Martin Kraemer]

  *) WIN32: Canonicalize ServerRoot before checking to see if it
     is a valid directory.  The failure to do this caused certain
     ServerRoot settings (eg. "ServerRoot /apache") to be improperly
     rejected.  [Marc Slemko]

  *) Global renaming of C header files to both get rid of conflicts with third
     party packages and to again reach consistency:
       1. conf.h      -> ap_config.h
       2. conf_auto.h -> ap_config_auto.h \ these are now merged
       3. ap_config.h -> ap_config_auto.h / in the config process
       4. compat.h    -> ap_compat.h
       5. apctype.h   -> ap_ctype.h
     Backward compatibility files for conf.h and compat.h were created.

  *) mod_mmap_static will no longer take action on requests unless at 
     least one "mmapfile" directive is present in the configuration. 
     This experimental module has to do some black magic to operate 
     inside the current API and thus creates side-effects for other 
     modules under some circumstances.
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]
 
  *) Add conservative ticks around more egrep arguments in top-level configure
     to avoid problems under brain-dead platforms like Digital UNIX (OSF1).
     [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2596

  *) mod_rewrite created RewriteLock files under the UID of the parent
     process, thus the child processes had no write access to the files.
     Now a chown() is done on the file to the uid of the children,
     if applicable.  [Lars Eilebrecht, Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2341

  *) Autogenerate some HAVE_XXXXX_H defines in conf_auto.h (determined via
     TestCompile) instead of defining them manually in conf.h based on less
     accurate platform definitions.  This way we no longer have to fiddle with
     OS-type and/or OS-version identifiers to discover whether a system header
     file exists or not.  Instead we now directly check for the existence of
     those esoteric ones.

  *) mod_setenvif (BrowserMatch* and friends) will now match a missing
     field with "^$".  [Ken Coar]

  *) Set the RTLD_GLOBAL dlopen mode parameter to allow dynamically loaded
     modules to load their own modules dynamically.  This improves mod_perl
     and mod_php3 when these modules are loaded dynamically into Apache.
     [Rasmus Lerdorf]

  *) Cache a proxied request in the event that the client cancels the
     transfer, provided that the configured percentage of the file has
     already been transfered. It works for HTTP transfers only.  The 
     new configuration directive is called CacheForceCompletion.

  *) Fix yet another signal-based race condition involving nested timers.
     Signals suck.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) suexec's error messages have been clarified a little bit.  [Ken Coar]

  *) Clean up some, but perhaps not all, 8-bit character set problems
     with config file parsing, and URL parsing.  We now define

  *) Add Dynamic Shared Object (DSO) support for SCO5 (OpenServer 5.0.x).
     [Ronald Record <rr@sco.com>] PR#2533

  *) The APACI libexecdir was not extended with an "apache/" subdir
     if the installation prefix didn't already contain "apache", but
     it should be because the DSO files are Apache-specific.  Now
     libexecdir is treated the same way sysconfdir, datadir, localstatedir
     and includedir are already treated.

  *) The <Limit> parsing routine was incorrectly treating methods as

  *) PORT: Add UnixWare 7 support
     [Vadim Kostoglodoff <vadim@olly.ru>] PR#2463

  *) Fix the Guess-DSO-flags-from-Perl stuff in src/Configure: "perl" was
     used instead of "$PERL" which contains the correctly determined Perl
     interpreter (important for instance on systems where "perl" and "perl5"
     exists, like BSDI or FreeBSD, etc).
     [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2505

  *) Move the initial suEXEC-related startup message from plain
     fprintf()/stderr to a delayed ap_log_error()-based one to avoid problems
     when Apache is started from inetd (instead of standalone). Under this
     situation startup messages on stderr lead to problems (the line is sent
     to the client in front of the requested document).

  *) WIN32: If we can't figure out how to execute a file in a script
     directory, bail out of the request with an error message.  [W G Stoddard]

  *) WIN32 SECURITY: Eliminate directories consisting of three or more dots;
     these are treated by Win32 as if they are ".." but are not detected by
     other machinery within Apache. This is something of a kludge but
     eliminates a security hole. [Manoj Kasichainula, Ben Laurie]

  *) Let APACI's configure script determine some configuration parameters
     (Group, Port, ServerAdmin, ServerName) via some intelligent tests to
     remove some of the classical hurdles for new users when setting up
     Apache. This is done per default because it is useful for the average
     user. Package authors can use the --without-confadjust option to disable
     these configuration adjustments.
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Added an EXTRA_DEPS configuration parameter which can be used
     to add an extra Makefile dependency for the httpd target, for instance
     to external third-party libraries, etc.
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Add <IfDefine>..</IfDefine> sections to the core module (with same spirit
     as <IfModule>..</IfModule> sections) which can be used to skip or process
     contained commands dependend of ``-D PARAMETER'' options on the command
     line. This can be used to achieve logical conditions like <IfDefine
     ReverseProxy> instead of physically ones (e.g. <IfModule mod_proxy.c>)
     and thus especially can be used for conditionally loading DSO-based
     modules via LoadModule, etc. [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) PORT: clean up a warning in mod_status for OS/2.  [Brian Havard]

  *) Make table elements const. This may prevent obscure errors. [Ben Laurie]

     PR#2412, 2367

  *) Portability fix for APACI shadow tree support: Swap order of awk and sed
     in top-level configure script to avoid sed fails on some platforms (for
     instance SunOS 4.1.3 and NCR SysV) because of the non-newline-termined
     output of Awk. [Bill Houle <bhoule@sandiegoca.ncr.com>] PR#2435

  *) Improve performance of directory listings (mod_autoindex) by comparing
     integer keys (last-modified and size) as integers rather than converting
     them to strings first.  Also use a set of explicit byte tests rather
     than strcmp() to check for parent directory-ness of an entry.  Oh, and
     make sure the parent directory (if displayed) is *always* listed first
     regardless of the sort key.  Overall performance winnage should be good
     in CPU time, instruction cache, and memory usage, particularly for large
     directories.  [Ken Coar]

  *) Add a tiny but useful goody to APACI's configure script: The generation
     of a config.status script (as GNU Autoconf does) which remembers the used
     configure command and hence can be used to restore the configuration by
     just re-running this script or for remembering the configuration between
     releases.
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Add httpd -t (test) option for running configuration syntax tests only.
     If something is broken it complains and exits with a return code
     non-equal to 0. This can be used manually by the user to check the Apache
     configuration after editing and is also automatically used by apachectl
     on (graceful) restart command to make sure Apache doesn't die on restarts
     because of a configuration which is now broken since the last (re)start.
     This way `apachectl restart' can be used inside cronjobs without having
     to expect Apache to be falling down. Additionally the httpd -t can be run
     via `apachectl configtest'.

     [Brian Behlendorf]

  *) Upgrade the child spawning code in mod_rewrite for the RewriteMap
     programs: ap_spawn_child_err() is used and the Win32 case now uses
     CreateProcess() instead of a low-level execl() (which caused problems in
     the past under Win32).
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) A few cosmetics and trivial enhancements to APXS to make the
     generated Makefile more user friendly. [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Proxy Fix: The proxy special failure routine ap_proxyerror()
     was updated to use the normal apache error processing, thereby allowing
     proxy errors to be treated by ErrorDocument's as well. For this
     purpose, a new module-to-core communication variable "error-notes"
     was introduced; the proxy (and possibly other modules) communicates
     its error text using this variable. Its content is copied to a new
     cgi-env-var REDIRECT_ERROR_NOTES for use by ErrorDocuments.
     The old proxy special error routine ap_proxy_log_uerror()
     was replaced by regular ap_log_error() calls, many messages were made
     more informative. 
     [Martin Kraemer] PR#494, 1259

  *) SECURITY: A possible buffer overflow in the ftp proxy was fixed.
     [Martin Kraemer]

  *) Transform the configure message "You need root privileges for suEXEC"
     from a fatal error into a (more friendly) warning because the building
     ("make") of Apache we can allow, of course. Root privileges are needed
     only for the installation step ("make install"). So make sure the
     user is aware of this fact but let him proceed as long as he can.
     [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2288
  
  *) Renamed three more functions to common ap_ prefix which we missed at the
     Big Symbol Renaming because they're #defines and not real C functions:
     is_default_port(), default_port(), http_method().
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) A zero-length name after a $ in an SSI document should cause
     just the $ to be in the expansion.  This was broken during the
     security fixes in 1.2.5.  [Dean Gaudet] PR#1921, 2249

  *) Call ap_destroy_sub_req() in ap_add_cgi_vars() to reclaim some
     memory.  [Rob Saccoccio <robs@InfiniteTechnology.com>] PR#2252

     used under AIX) because of recent changes to function names.
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

Changes with Apache 1.3b7

  *) Make sure a MIME-type can be forced via a RewriteRule even when no
     substitution takes place, for instance via the following rule:
     ``RewriteRule ^myscript$ - [T=application/x-httpd-cgi]'' This was often
     requested by users in the past to force a single script without a .cgi
     extension and outside any cgi-bin dirs to be executed as a CGI program.
     [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2254

  *) A fix for protocol issues surrounding 400, 408, and

     trying to connect to certain ftpd's, such as anonftpd.  
     [Rick Ohnemus <rick@ecompcon.com>]

  *) Make mod_rewrite use ap_open_piped_log() for RewriteLog directive's
     logfile instead of fiddling around itself with child spawning stuff.
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Made RefererIgnore case-insensitive.

  *) Mod_log_agent, mod_log_referer now use ap_open_piped_log for piped logs.
     [Brian Behlendorf]

  *) Replace use of spawn_child with ap_spawn_child_err_buff, to make everything
     "safe" under Win32.  In: mod_include.c, mod_mime_magic.c
     [Brian Behlendorf]

  *) Improve RFC1413 support. [Bob Beck <beck@bofh.ucs.ualberta.ca>]

  *) Fix support script `dbmmanage': It was unable to handle some sort
     of passwords, especially passwords with "0" chars.
     [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2242

  *) WIN32: Clicking on "Last Modified" in a fancy index caused a crash. Fixed.
     [Ben Laurie] PR#2238

  *) WIN32: CGIs could cause a hang (because of a deadlock in the standard C
     library), so CGI handling has been changed to use Win32 native handles
     instead of C file descriptors.
     [Ben Laurie and Bill Stoddard <wgstodda@us.ibm.com>] PR#1129, 1607

  *) The proxy cache would store an incorrect content-length in the cached
     file copy after a cache update. That resulted in repeated fetching
     of the original copy instead of using the cached copy.
     [Ernst Kloppenburg <kloppen@isr.uni-stuttgart.de>] PR#2094

  *) The Makefiles assumed that DSO files are build via $(LD). This
     is broken for two reasons: First we never defined at least LD=ld
     somewhere to make sure this works (it was silently assumed that most Make
     provide a built-in LD definition - ARGL!) and second using the generic LD
     variable is not the truth. Instead a special variable named LD_SHLIB is
     reasonable because although "ld" is usually the default, the command for
     building DSO files can be "libtool" or even "cc" on some systems.
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Replace the AddVersionPlatform directive with ServerTokens which
     provides for more control over the format of the Server:
     header line. SERVER_SUBVERSION is no longer supported;
     all module should use the ap_add_version_component()
     API function instead. [Jim Jagielski]

  *) Support for the NCR MP/RAS 3.0
     [John Withers <withers@semi.kcsc.mwr.irs.gov>]

  *) The LDFLAGS_SHLIB_EXPORT variable of src/Configuration[.tmpl] was
     not retrieved in src/Configure and thus was not useable.
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]
 
  *) Various Makefile consistency cleanups:
     - make OSDIR also automatically be relative to src/ like INCDIR
     - SUBDIRS is now generated in src/Makefile only and not in
       Makefile.config because it is a local define for this location.
     - remove BROKEN_BPRINTF_FLAGS because is it no longer used inside
       any Makefile but make sure that at least the "-K inline" is kept in
       CFLAGS for SCO 5.
     - update the "depend" targets in Makefile.tmpl files to use $(OSDIR), too.
     - updated the dependencies theirself
     - removed not existing SHLIB variable from "clean" targets
     - replaced SHLIB_OBJS/SHLIBS_OBJ consistently with OBJS_PIC because OBJS
       already exists and OBJS_PIC are also just plain objects and have not
       directly to do with "shared" things. The only difference is that they
       contain PIC. So OBJS_PIC is the more canonical name.
     - Updated the Makefile-dependency lines for OBJS_PIC
     - Removed the Makefile-dependency line in Configure to avoid double
       definitions
     - replaced ugly xx-so.o/xx.so-o hack with a clean and consistent usage
       of xxx.lo as GNU libtool does with its PIC objects
     - reduce local complexity in modules Makefile.tmpl by moving the last
       existing target "depend" to the generation section in Configure, too.
     - removed the historical $(SPACER) which was used in the past together
       with BROKEN_BPRINTF_FLAGS to avoid zig-zags in the build process. This
       is no longer needed.
     - force the build and run of the gen_xxx programs under main/ as the
       first step before building the objects because it looks cleaner
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) WIN32: Don't force ISAPI headers to finish with \n.
     [Jim Patterson <Jim.Patterson@Cognos.COM>, Ben Laurie] PR#2060

  *) When opening "configuration" files (like httpd.conf, htaccess
     and htpasswd), Apache will not allow them to be non-/dev/null
     device files. This closes a DoS hole. At the same time,
     we use ap_pfopen to open these files to handle timeouts.
     [Jim Jagielski, Martin Kraemer]

  *) Apache will now log the reason its httpd children exit if they exit
     due to an unexpected signal.  (It requires a new porting define,
     SYS_SIGLIST, which if defined should point to a list of text
     descriptions of the signals available.  See PORTING.)  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) WIN32: chdir() doesn't make sense in a multithreaded environment 
     like WIN32.  Before, Win32 CGI's could have had sporadic failures 
     if a chdir call from one thread was made between another chdir call 
     and a spawn in another thread.  So, for now don't chdir for CGI scripts 
     in WIN32.  The current CGI "spec" is unclear as to whether it's 
     necessary.  Long-term fix is to either serialize the chdir/spawn combo 
     or use WIN32 native calls to spawn a process.  This temp fix was 
     necessary to remove this as a showstopper for 1.3's release. 
     [Brian Behlendorf]

  *) Cleanup the suEXEC support in APACI and make it more safe:
     1. Add big fat hint in INSTALL about risks and to read the
        htdocs/manual/suexec.html document before using the suexec-related
        configure options.
     2. Make sure the user has at least provided one --suexec-xxxx option
        (specifies suEXEC parameters) in addition to --enable-suexec option.
        If only --enable-suexec is given APACI stops with a hint to INSTALL
        and htdocs/manual/suexec.html documents.
     3. Provide two additional --suexec-xxxx options to make the suEXEC
        configuration complete (especially for package maintainers who else
        had to patch the source tree) by providing ways to configure minimal
        UID/GID and safe PATH, too.
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Cleanup of the `configure --shadow' process:
     - make sure the configure script creates its temporary files in the
       shadow tree to avoid conflicts with parallel configure runs
     - removed unnecessary option "-r" from "rm" call for Makefiles
     - make sure the configure scripts creates the shadow-wrapper Makefile
       only when no shadow trees already exists
     - make sure "make distclean" removes the shadow-wrapper Makefile but only
       when no more shadow trees exists
     - overhauled mkshadow.sh script: now its more IFS-safe and approx. twice
       as fast (in the past it needed 70sec, now it runs just 38sec)
     - make sure CVS does not complain about the created files
       Makefille.<gnutriple> and directories src.<gnutriple>
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Added the ap_add_version_component() API routine and the
     AddVersionPlatform core directive.  The first allows modules to
     declare themselves in the Server response header field value,
     augmenting the SERVER_SUBVERSION define in the Configuration file
     with run-time settings (more useful in a loadable-module environment).
     AddVersionPlatform inserts a comment such as "(UNIX)" or "(Win32)"
     into the server version string.  [Ken Coar] PR#2056

  *) Minor stability tweaks to avoid core dumps in ap_snprintf.
     [Martin Kraemer]

  *) Add a note to httpd.conf-dist that apache will on some systems fail
     to start when the Group # is set to a negative or large positive value.
     [Martin Kraemer]

  *) Make sure the module execution order is correct even when some modules
     are loaded under runtime (`LoadModule') via the DSO mechanism:
     1. The list of loaded modules is now a dynamically allocated one
        and not the original statically list from modules.c
     2. The loaded modules are now correctly setup by LoadModule for
        later use by the AddModule command.
     3. When the DSO mechanism for modules is used APACI's `install'
        target now enables all created `LoadModule' lines per default because
        this is both already expected by the user _and_ needed to avoid
        confusion with the next point and reduces the Makefile.tmpl complexity
     4. When the DSO mechanism for modules is used, APACI's `install'
        target now additionally makes sure the module list is reconstructed
        via a complete `ClearModuleList+AddModule...' entry.
     5. The support tool `apxs' now also makes sure an AddModule command
        is added in addition to the LoadModule command.
     6. The modules.c generation was extended to now contain two
        comments to make sure no one is confused by the confusing terminology
        of loading/linking (we use load=link+load & link=activate instead of
        the obvious load=activate & link=link :-( )
     This way now there is no longer a difference under execution time between
     statically and dynamically linked modules.

     r->server->server_hostname to ap_get_server_name().  And I changed some 
     functions which use r->server->port to use ap_get_server_port() instead, 
     because if there's no Port directive in the config r->server->port is 0.

     Additionally the checks for finding the vendor DSO library were moved

  *) Add Dynamic Shared Object (DSO) support for AIX (at least 4.2 but older
     AIX variants should work fine, too. Even AIX 3.x should work). This is
     accomplished by using the free DSO emulation code from Jens-Uwe Mager

     whether errno is set or not.  [Martin Kraemer]

  *) Just having APACI's localstatedir is too general and not enough for most
     of the systems. 1.3b6 again required manual APACI patches by package
     maintainers from Red Hat and FreeBSD because for their filesystem layout a
     little bit more flexibility in configuring the paths is needed. Hence we
     provide three additional configure options (--runtimedir, --logfiledir,
     --proxycachedir) which now can be used for more granular adjustments if
     --localstatedir is not enough to fit the particular needs. As a nice
     side-effect this reduces some subdir fiddling in configure+Makefile.tmpl.
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Make the install root for "make install" in APACI's Makefile overrideable
     by package authors.  This way we are even more friendly to package
     maintainers (especially Debian and Red Hat) who build for the real prefix
     via "configure --prefix=/<real>" but use a different local prefix via
     "make root=/tmp/apache install" for rolling the package without bristling
     the target location on their system.

     [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Because /usr/local/apache is the default prefix the ``configure
     --compat'' option no longer has to set prefix, again. This way the

  *) PORT: Cast the first argument of dlopen() in ap_os_dso_load()

  *) ++++ THE BIG SYMBOL RENAMING ++++
     To avoid symbol clashes with third-party code compiled into the server,
     we globally applied the prefix "ap_" to the following classes of
     functions:
        - Apache provided general functions (e.g., ap_cpystrn)
        - Public API functions (e.g., palloc, bgets)
        - Private functions which we can't make static (because of
          cross-object usage) but should be (e.g., new_connection)
     For backward source compatibility a new header file named compat.h was
     created which provides defines for the old symbol names and can be used
     by third-party module authors.
     [The Apache Group]

  *) Added dynamic shared object (DSO) support for SVR4-derivates: The
     problem under SVR4 is that there is no command flag to force the linker
     to export the global symbols of the httpd executable therewith they are
     available to the DSO's. Instead of problematic hacks like creating a
     dummy.so file (containing dummy references to all global symbols) the
     httpd binary is linked against, we use a clean trick stolen from Perl 5:
     Placing the Apache core code itself into a DSO library named libhttpd.so.
     This way the global symbols _HAVE_ to be exported and thus are available
     to any manually loaded DSO's under runtime. To reduce the impact to the
     user to null we go even further and create a stub httpd executable which
     automatically keeps track of the DSO library loading itself and thus
     hides the complete mechanism from the user. Although the generation of
     this DSO library is automatically triggered for platforms which
     essentially need it (mostly all SVR4-derivates) it can be also enabled
     manually via the Rule SHARED_CORE. This can be interesting in the future
     where we perhaps exploit this libhttpd.so mechanism for providing nifty
     features like graceful upgrades, or whatever. 
     [Ralf S. Engelschall, Martin Kraemer]

  *) Build the libraries before building the rest of the tools. [Ben Hyde]

  *) Add "distclean" target to src/-Makefiles to provide "make distclean" also
     inside the src subtree (i.e. for non-APACI users). Following GNU Makefile
     conventions while "clean" removes only stuff created by "all" targets,
     "distclean" additionally removes the stuff from the configuration
     process. This way "make distclean" (hence the name) provides a fresh
     source tree as it was for distribution.
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Allow top-level (APACI) Makefile to break on build errors
     the same way the src/ subtree Makefiles breaks on them by replacing the
     initial APACI sed-subdir-display-kludge with a more clean
     variable-passing-solution: variable SDP can optionally hold the subdir
     prefix which is consistently used for displaying the subdir movement.
     This way even the top-level Makefile can stop correctly on errors as the
     user expects. [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Fixed ordering of argument checks for RewriteBase directive.
     [Todd Eigenschink <eigenstr@mixi.net>] PR#2045

  *) Change Win32 IS_MODULE to SHARED_MODULE to match Unix' method of
     indicating that a module is being compiled for dynamic loading. Also
     remove #define IS_MODULE from modules and add SHARED_MODULE define
     to the mak/dsp files. [Alexei Kosut]

  *) Reduce logging level of "normal" warning messages to APLOG_INFO,
     since we are now logging APLOG_WARNING by default. [Roy Fielding]

  *) PORT: OS/2 tweak to deal with multiple .exe targets. [Brian Havard]
 
  *) Add documentation file and src/Configuration.tmpl entry for the
     experimental mod_mmap_static module. Because although it is and marked as
     an experimental one it is distributed and thus should be documented and
     prepared for configuration the same way as all others modules. 
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Add query (-q) option to apxs support tool to be able to manually query
     specific settings from apxs. This is needed for instance when you
     manually want to access Apache's header files and you need to assemble
     the -I option.  Now you can do -I`apxs -q INCLUDEDIR`.
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Now src/Configure uses a fallback strategy for the shared object support
     on platforms where no explicit information is available: If a Perl
     installation exists we ask it about its shared object support and if it's
     the dlopen-style one we shamelessly guess the compiler and linker flags
     for creating shared objects from Perls knowledge. Of course, the user is
     warning about what we are doing and informed that he should send us
     the guessed flags when they work. [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Provide APACI --without-support option to be able to disable the build
     and installation of the support tools from the src/support/ area.
     Although its useful to have these installed per default we should provide
     a way to compile and install without them for backward-compatibility.
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Add of the new APache eXtenSion (apxs) support tool for building and
     installing modules into an _already installed_ Apache package through the
     dynamic shared object (DSO) mechanism [mod_so.c]. The trick here is that
     this approach actually doesn't need the Apache source tree.  The
     (APACI-installed) server package is enough, because this now includes the
     Apache C header files (PREFIX/include) and the new APXS tool
     (SBINDIR/apxs).  The intend is to provide a handy tool for third-party
     module authors to build their Apache modules _OUTSIDE_ the Apache source
     tree while avoiding them to fiddle around with the totally platform
     dependend way of compiling DSO files. The tool supports all ranges of
     modules, from trivial ones (single mod_foo.c) to complex ones (like PHP3
     which has a mod_php3.c plus a pre-built libmodphp3-so.a) and even can
     on-the-fly generate a minimalistic Makefile and sample module for the
     first step to provide both a quick success event and to demonstrate the
     APXS mechanism to module authors. [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Fix core dumps in use of CONNECT in proxy.

  *) Modify the log directives in httpd.conf-dist files to use CustomLog
     so that users have examples of how CustomLog can be used.
     [Lars Eilebrecht]

  *) Add the new Apache Autoconf-style Interface (APACI) for the top-level of
     the Apache distribution tree.  Until Apache 1.3 there was no real
     out-of-the-box batch-capable build and installation procedure for the
     complete Apache package. This is now provided by a top-level "configure"
     script and a corresponding top-level "Makefile.tmpl" file.  The goal is
     to provide a GNU Autoconf-style frontend which is capable to both drive
     the old src/Configure stuff in batch and additionally installs the
     package with a GNU-conforming directory layout. Any options from the old
     configuration scheme are available plus a lot of new options for flexibly
     customizing Apache. [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) "Options +Includes" wasn't correctly merged if "+IncludesNoExec"
     was defined in a parent directory. [Lars Eilebrecht]

  *) API: ap_snprintf() code mutated into ap_vformatter(), which is
     a generic printf-style routine that can call arbitrary output
     routines.  Use this to replace http_bprintf.c.  Add new routines
     psprintf(), pvsprintf() which allocate the exact amount of memory
     required for a string from a pool.  Use psprintf() to clean up
     various bits of code which used ap_snprintf()/pstrdup().
     [Dean Gaudet]

  *) PORT: HAVE_SNPRINTF doesn't do anything any longer.  This is because
     ap_snprintf() has different semantics and formatting codes than
     snprintf().  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) SIGXCPU and SIGXFSZ are now reset to SIG_DFL at boot-time.  This

  *) Allow %2F in two situations: 1) it is in the query part of the URI,
     therefore not exposed to %2F -> '/' translations and 2) the request
     is a proxy request, so we're not dealing with a local resource anyway.
     Without this, the proxy would fail to work for any URL's with

  *) Reanimated the (still undocumented) proxy receive buffer size directive:
     Renamed from ReceiveBufferSize to ProxyReceiveBufferSize because the old

  *) Add five new and fresh manpages for the support programs: dbmmanage.1,
     suexec.8, htdigest.1, rotatelogs.8 and logresolve.8.  Now all up-to-date
     and per default compiled support programs have manual pages - just to
     document our stuff a little bit more and to be able to do really
     Unix-like installations ;-) [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Major cleanups to the Configure script to make it and its generated
     Makefiles again readable and maintainable: add SRCDIR option, removed
     INCLUDES_DEPTH[0-2] kludge, cleanup of TARGET option, cleanup of
     generated sections, consequently added Makefile headers with inheritance
     information, added subdir movement messages for easier following where
     the build process currently stays (more verbose then standard Make, less
     verbose than GNU make), same style to comments in the Configure script,
     added Apache license header, fixed a few bugs, etc. [Ralf S. Engelschall]
     
  *) Add the new ApacheBench program "ab" to src/support/: This is derived
     from the ZeusBench benchmarking program and can be used to determine the

  *) Performance tweak to mod_log_config.  [Dmitry Khrustalev]

  *) Clean up some undocumented behavior of mod_setenvif related to
     "merging" two SetEnvIf directives when they match the same header
     and regex.  Document that mod_setenvif will perform comparisons in
     the order they appear in the config file.  Optimize mod_setenvif by
     doing more work at config time rather than at runtime.
     [Dean Gaudet]

  *) src/include/ap_config.h now wraps it's #define's with #ifndef/#endif's
     to allow for modules to overrule them and to reduce redefinition
     warnings [Jim Jagielski]

  *) [PORT] For A/UX change the OS-#define for -DAUX to -DAUX3.
     [Jim Jagielski]

  *) Making the hard-coded cross-module function call mime_find_ct() (from
     mod_proxy to mod_mime) obsolete by making sure the API hook for MIME type
     checking is really called even for proxy requests except for URLs with
     HTTP schemes (because there we can optimize by not running the type
     checking hooks due to the fact that the proxy gets the MIME Content-type
     from the remote host later). This change cleans up mod_mime by removing
     the ugly export kludge, makes the one-liner file mod_mime.h obsolete, and
     especially unbundles mod_proxy and mod_mime. This way they both now can
     be compiled as shared objects and are no longer tied together. 
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) util.c cleanup and speedup. [Dean Gaudet]

  *) API: Clarification, pstrndup() will always copy n bytes of the source
     and NUL terminate at the (n+1)st byte.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Mark module command_rec and handler_rec structures const so that they
     end up in the read-only data section (and are friendlier to systems
     that don't do optimistic memory allocation on fork()). [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Add check to the "Port" directive to make sure the specified 
     port is in the appropriate range.  [Ben Hyde]

  *) Performance improvements to invoke_handler().
     [Dmitry Khrustalev <dima@bog.msu.su>]

  *) Added support for building shared objects even for library-style modules
     (which are built from more than one object file). This now provides the
     ability to build mod_proxy as a shared object module. Additionally
     modules like mod_example are now also supported for shared object
     building because the generated Makefiles now no longer assume there is at
     least one statically linked module. [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) API: Clarify usage of content_type, handler, content_encoding,
     content_language and content_languages fields in request_rec.  They
     must always be lowercased; and the strings pointed to shouldn't
     be modified (you must copy them to modify them).  Fix a few bugs
     related to this.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) API: Clarification: except for RAW_ARGS, all command handlers can
     treat the char * parameters as permanent, and modifiable.  There
     is no need to pstrdup() them.  Clean up some needless pstrdup().
     [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Now mod_so keeps track of which module shared objects with which names
     are loaded and thus avoids multiple loading and unloading and irritating
     error_log messages. [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Prior to the existence of mod_setenv it was necessary to tweak the TZ
     environment variable in the apache core.  But that tweaking interferes
     with mod_setenv.  So don't tweak if the user has specified an explicit

  *) The CGI spec says that REMOTE_HOST should be set to the remote hosts's
     name, or left unset if this value is unavailable.  Apache was setting
     it to the IP address when unavailable.

  *) Various improvements to the configuration and build support for compiling
     modules as shared objects. Especially Solaris 2.x, SunOS 4.1, IRIX and
     OSF1 support with GCC and vendor compilers was added.  This way shared
     object support is now provided out-of-the-box for FreeBSD, Linux,
     Solaris, SunOS, IRIX and OSF1. In short: On all major platforms!
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Minor cleanup in http_main -- split QNX and OS2 specific "mmap"
     scoreboard code into separate #defines -- USE_POSIX_SCOREBOARD
     and USE_OS2_SCOREBOARD.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Fix one more special locking problem for RewriteMap programs in
     mod_rewrite: According to the documentation of flock(), "Locks are on
     files, not file descriptors.  That is, file descriptors duplicated
     through dup(2) or fork(2) do not result in multiple instances of a lock,
     but rather multiple references to a single lock. If a process holding a
     lock on a file forks and the child explicitly unlocks the file, the
     parent will lose its lock.". To overcome this we have to make sure the
     RewriteLock file is opened _AFTER_ the childs were spawned which is now
     the case by opening it in the child_init instead of the module_init API
     hook. [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#1029

  *) Change to Location and LocationMatch semantics.  LocationMatch no
     longer lets a single slash match multiple adjacent slashes in the
     URL.  This change is for consistency with RewriteRule and
     AliasMatch.  Multiple slashes have meaning in URLs that they do
     not have in (some) filesystems.  Location on the other hand can
     be considered a shorthand for a more complicated regex, and it
     does match multiple slashes with a single slash -- which is
     also consistent with the Alias directive.

  *) Fix bug with mod_mime_magic causing certain files, including files
     of length 0, to result in no response from the server.
     [Dean Gaudet]

  *) The Configure script now generates src/include/ap_config.h which
     contains the set of defines used when Apache is compiled on a platform.
     This file can then be included by external modules before including
     any Apache header files in case they are being built separately from
     Apache.  Along with this change, a couple of minor changes were
     made to make Apache's #defines coexist peacefully with any autoconf
     defines an external module might have. [Rasmus Lerdorf]

  *) Fix mod_rewrite for the ugly API case where <VirtualHost> sections exist
     but without any RewriteXXXXX directives. Here mod_rewrite is given no
     chance by the API to initialize its per-server configuration and thus
     receives the wrong one from the main server. This is now avoided by
     remembering the server together with the config structure while
     configuring and later assuming there is no config when we see a
     difference between the remembered server and the one calling us. 
     [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#1790

  *) Fixed the DBM RewriteMap support for mod_rewrite: First the support now
     is automatically disabled under configure time when the dbm_xxx functions
     are not available. Second, two heavy source code errors in the DBM
     support code were fixed.  This makes DBM RewriteMap's usable again after
     a long time of brokenness. [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#1696

  *) Now all configuration files support Unix-style line-continuation via 
     the trailing backslash ("\") character. This enables us to write down
     complex or just very long directives in a more readable way.  The
     backslash character has to be really the last character before the
     newline and it has not been prefixed by another (escaping) backslash.

  *) When using ProxyPass the ?querystring was not passed correctly.
     [Joel Truher <truher@wired.com>]

  *) To deal with modules being compiled and [dynamically] linked
     at a different time from the core, the SERVER_VERSION and
     SERVER_BUILT symbols have been abstracted through the new
     API routines apapi_get_server_version() and apapi_get_server_built().

  *) WIN32: Preserve trailing slash in canonical path (and hence
     in PATH_INFO). [Paul Sutton, Ben Laurie]

  *) PORT: USE_PTHREAD_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT has proven unreliable
     depending on the rev of Solaris and what mixture of modules
     are in use.  So it has been disabled, and Solaris is back to
     using USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT.  Users may experiment with
     USE_PTHREAD_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT at their own risk, it may speed
     up static content only servers.  Or it may fail unpredictably.
     [Dean Gaudet] PR#1779, 1854, 1904

  *) mod_test_util_uri.c created which tests the logic in util_uri.c.
     [Dean Gaudet]

  *) API: Rewrite of absoluteURI handling, and in particular how
     absoluteURIs match vhosts.  Unless a request is a proxy request, a
     "http://host" url is treated as if a similar "Host:" header had been
     supplied.  This change was made to support future HTTP/1.x protocols
     which may require clients to send absoluteURIs for all requests.

     In order to achieve this change subtle changes were made to the API.  In a
     request_rec, r->hostlen has been removed.  r->unparsed_uri now exists so
     that the unmodified uri can be retrieved easily.  r->proxyreq is not set
     by the core, modules must set it during the post_read_request or
     translate_names phase.

     Plus changes to the virtualhost test suite for absoluteURI testing.

     This fixes several bugs with the proxy proxying requests to vhosts
     managed by the same httpd.
     [Dean Gaudet]

  *) API: Cleanup of code in http_vhost.c, and remove vhost matching
     code from mod_rewrite.  The vhost matching is now performed by a
     globally available function matches_request_vhost().  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Reduce memory usage, and speed up ServerAlias support.  As a
     side-effect users can list multiple ServerAlias directives
     and they're all considered.

  *) Make \\ behave as expected.  [Ronald.Tschalaer@psi.ch]

  *) Add the `%a' construct to LogFormat and CustomLog to log the client IP
     address. [Todd Eigenschink <eigenstr@mixi.net>] PR#1885

  *) API: A new source module main/util_uri.c; It contains a routine
     parse_uri_components() and friends which breaks a URI into its component
     parts.  These parts are stored in a uri_components structure called
     parsed_uri within each request_rec, and are available to all modules.
     Additionally, an unparse routine is supplied which re-assembles the URI
     components back to an URI, optionally hiding the username:password@ part
     from ftp proxy requests, and other useful routines.  Within the structure,
     you find on a ready-for-use basis:
        scheme;     /* scheme ("http"/"ftp"/...) */
        hostinfo;   /* combined [user[:password]@]host[:port] */
        user;       /* user name, as in http://user:passwd@host:port/ */
        password;   /* password, as in http://user:passwd@host:port/ */
        hostname;   /* hostname from URI (or from Host: header) */
        port_str;   /* port string (integer representation is in "port") */
        path;       /* the request path (or "/" if only scheme://host was given) */
        query;      /* Everything after a '?' in the path, if present */
        fragment;   /* Trailing "#fragment" string, if present */
     This is meant to serve as the platform for *BIG* savings in
     code complexity for the proxy module (and maybe the vhost logic).
     [Martin Kraemer]

  *) Make all possible meta-construct expansions ($N, %N, %{NAME} and
     ${map:key}) available for all location where a string is created in
     mod_rewrite rewriting rulesets: 1st arg of RewriteCond, 2nd arg of
     RewriteRule and for the [E=NAME:STRING] flag of RewriteRule. This way the
     possible expansions are consequently usable at all string creation
     locations. [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Fix initialization of RewriteLogLevel (default now is 0 as documented 
     and not 1) and the per-virtual-server merging of directives. Now all
     directives except `RewriteEngine' and `RewriteOption' are either
     completely overridden (default) or completely inherited (when
     `RewriteOptions inherit') is used. [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#1325

  *) Fix `RewriteMap' program lookup in situations where such maps are
     defined but disabled (`RewriteEngine off') in per-server context. 
     [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#1431

  *) Fix bug introduced in 1.3b4-dev, config with no Port setting would cause
     server to bind to port 0 rather than 80.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Fix long-standing problem with RewriteMap _programs_ under Unix derivates
     (like SunOS and FreeBSD) which don't accept the locking of pipes
     directly.  A new directive RewriteLock is introduced which can be used to
     setup a separate locking file which then is used for synchronization.

  *) The mod_setenvif BrowserMatch backwards compatibility command did not
     work properly with spaces in the regex.  [Ronald Tschalaer] PR#1825

  *) Add new RewriteMap types: First, `rnd' which is equivalent to the `txt'
     type but with a special post-processing for the looked-up value: It
     parses it into alternatives according to `|' chars and then only one
     particular alternative is chosen randomly (this is an essential
     functionality needed for balancing between backend-servers when using
     Apache as a Reverse Proxy.  The looked up value here is a list of
     servers). Second, `int' with the built-in maps named `tolower' and
     `toupper' which can be used to map URL parts to a fixed case (this is an
     essential feature to fix the case of server names when doing mass
     virtual-hosting with the help of mod_rewrite instead of using
     <VirtualHost> sections). [Ralf S. Engelschall, parts based on code from
     Jay Soffian <jay@cimedia.com>] PR#1631

  *) Add a new directive to mod_proxy similar to ProxyPass: `ProxyPassReverse'.
     This directive lets Apache adjust the URL in Location-headers on HTTP
     redirect responses sent by the remote server. This way the virtually
     mapped area is no longer left on redirects and thus by-passed which is
     especially essential when running Apache as a reverse proxy.

Changes with Apache 1.3b4

  *) The module structure was modified to include a *dynamic_load_handle

     configuration files.  [Lars Eilebrecht]

  *) MiNT port update. [Jan Paul Schmidt]

  *) HTTP/1.1 requires x-gzip and gzip encodings be treated
     equivalent, similarly for x-compress and compress.  Apache
     now ignores a leading x- when comparing encodings.  It also
     preserves the encoding the client requests (for example if
     it requests x-gzip, then Apache will respond with x-gzip
     in the Content-Encoding header).
     [Ronald Tschalaer <Ronald.Tschalaer@psi.ch>] PR#1772

  *) Fix a memory leak on keep-alive connections.  [Igor Tatarinov]

  *) Added mod_so module to support dynamic loading of modules on Unix

     [Sameer Parekh, Paul Sutton]

  *) Minor cleanups to r->finfo handling in some modules.

     different protocols easier. [Ben Laurie, Randy Terbush]

  *) There are many cases where users do not want Apache to form
     self-referential urls using the "canonical" ServerName and Port.
     The new UseCanonicalName directive (default on), if set to off
     will cause Apache to use the client-supplied hostname and port.
     API: Part of this change required a change to the construct_url()
     prototype; and the addition of get_server_name() and
     get_server_port().
     [Michael Douglass <mikedoug@texas.net>, Dean Gaudet]
     PR#315, 459, 485, 1433

  *) Yet another rearrangement of the source tree.. now all the common
     header files are in the src/include directory.  The -Imain -Iap
     references in Makefiles have been changed to the simpler -Iinclude
     instead.  In addition to simplifying the build a little bit, this
     also makes it clear when a module is referencing something in a
     other than kosher manner (e.g., the proxy including mod_mime.h).
     Module-private header files (the proxy, mod_mime, the regex library,
     and mod_rewrite) have not been moved to src/include; nor have
     the OS-abstraction files.  [Ken Coar]

  *) Fix a bug where r->hostname didn't have the :port stripped
     from it.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Tweaked the headers_out table size, and the subprocess_env
     table size guess in rename_original_environment().  Added
     MAKE_TABLE_PROFILE which can help discover make_table()
     calls that use too small an initial guess, see alloc.c.
     [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Options and AllowOverride weren't properly merging in the main
     server setting inside vhosts (only an issue when you have no
     <Directory> or other section containing an Options that affects
     a request).  Options +foo or -foo in the main_server wouldn't
     affect the main_server's lookup defaults.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Variable 'cwd' was being used pointlessly before being set.

  *) r->allowed handling cleaned up in the standard modules.

  *) SIGURG doesn't exist everywhere.
     [Mark Andrew Heinrich <heinrich@tinderbox.Stanford.EDU>]

  *) mod_unique_id was erroneously generating a second unique id when
     an internal redirect occured.  Such redirects occur, for example,
     when processing a DirectoryIndex match.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) API: table_add, table_merge, and table_set include implicit pstrdup()
     of the key and value.  But in many cases this is not required
     because the key/value is a constant, or the value has been built
     by pstrcat() or other similar means.  New routines table_addn,
     table_mergen, and table_setn have been added to the API, these
     routines do not pstrdup() their arguments.  The core code and
     standard modules were changed to take advantage of these routines.
     The resulting server is up to 20% faster in some situations.

     Note that it is easy to get code subtly wrong if you pass a key/value
     which is in a pool other than the pool of the table.  The only
     safe thing to do is to pass key/values which are in the pool of
     the table, or in one of the ancestors of the pool of the table.
     i.e. if the table is part of a subrequest, a value from the main
     request's pool is OK since the subrequest pool is a sub_pool of the
     main request's pool (and therefore has a lifespan at most as long as
     the main pool).  There is debugging code which can detect improper
     usage, enabled by defining POOL_DEBUG.  See alloc.c for more details.
     [Dmitry Khrustalev <dima@bog.msu.su>, Dean Gaudet]

  *) More mod_mime_magic cleanup:  fewer syscalls; should handle "files"
     which don't exist on disk more gracefully; handles vhosts properly.
     Update documentation to reflect the code -- if there's no
     MimeMagicFile directive then the module is not enabled.
     [Dean Gaudet]

  *) PORT: Some older *nix dialects cannot automatically start scripts
     which begin with a #! interpreter line (the shell starts the scripts
     appropriately on these platforms). Apache now supports starting of
     "hashbang-scripts" when the NEED_HASHBANG_EMUL define is set.
     [Martin Kraemer, with code from peter@zeus.dialix.oz.au (Peter Wemm)
     taken from tcsh]

  *) API: "typedef array_header table" removed from alloc.h, folks should
     have been writing to use table as if it were an opaque type, but even
     some standard modules got this wrong.  By changing the definition
     to "typedef struct table table" module authors will receive compile
     time warnings that they're doing the wrong thing.  This change
     facilitates future changes with more sophisticated table
     structures.  Specifically, module authors should be using table_elts()
     to get access to an array_header * for the table. [Dean Gaudet]

  *) API: Renamed new_connection() to avoid namespace collision with LDAP
     library routines.  [Ken Coar, Rasmus Lerdorf]

  *) WIN32: mod_speling is now available on the Win32 platform.
     [Marc Slemko]

  *) For clarity the following compile time definition was changed:

        SAFE_UNSERIALIZED_ACCEPT  ->   SINGLE_LISTEN_UNSERIALIZED_ACCEPT

     Also, for example, HAVE_MMAP would mean to use mmap() scoreboards
     and not be a general notice that the OS has mmap(). Now the
     HAVE_MMAP/SHMGET #defines strictly are informational that the
     OS has that method of shared memory; the type to use for
     the scoreboard is a seperate #define (USE_MMAP_SCOREBOARD
     and USE_SHMGET_SCOREBOARD). This allows outside modules to
     determine if shared memory is available and allows Apache
     to determine the best method to use for the scoreboard.
     [Jim Jagielski]

  *) PORT: UnixWare 2.1.2 SMP appears to require USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT,
     as do various earlier versions.  It should be safe on all versions.
     Unixware 1.x appears to have the same SIGHUP bug as solaris does with
     the slack code.  A few other cleanups for Unixware.

  *) PORT: A/UX can handle single-listen accepts without mutex
     locking, so we add SINGLE_LISTEN_UNSERIALIZED_ACCEPT. [Jim Jagielski]

  *) When die() happens we need to eat any request body if one exists.
     Otherwise we can't continue with a keepalive session.  This shows up
     as a POST problem with MSIE 4.0, typically against pages which are
     authenticated.  [Roy Fielding] PR#1399

  *) If you define SECURITY_HOLE_PASS_AUTHORIZATION then the Authorization
     header will be passed to CGIs.  This is generally a security hole, so

  *) WIN32 deserves a pid file.  [Ben Hyde]

  *) suexec errors now include the errno/description.  [Marc Slemko] PR#1543

  *) PORT: OSF/1 now uses USE_FLOCK_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT to solve PR#467.
     The choice of flock vs. fcntl was made based on timings which showed that
     even on non-NFS, non-exported filesystems fcntl() was an order of
     magnitude slower.  It also uses SINGLE_LISTEN_UNSERIALIZED_ACCEPT so
     that single socket users will see no difference. [Dean Gaudet] PR#467

  *) "File does not exist" error message was erroneously including the
     errno.  [Marc Slemko]

  *) Improve the warning message generated when a client drops the
     connection (hits stop button, etc.) during a send.  [Roy Fielding]

  *) Defining GPROF will disable profiling in the parent and enable it
     in the children.  If you're profiling under Linux this is pretty much
     necessary because SIGPROF is lost across a fork(). [Dean Gaudet]

  *) htdigest and htpasswd needed slight tweaks to work on OS/2 and WIN32.
     [Brian Havard]

  *) The NeXT cc (which is gcc hacked up) doesn't appear to support some
     gcc functionality.  Work around it.

  *) Some linkers complain when .o files contain no functions.
     [Keith Severson <keith@sssd.navy.mil>] PR#1614

  *) Some const declarations in mod_imap.c that were added for debugging
     purposes caused some compilers heartburn without adding any
     significant value, so they've been removed.  [Ken Coar]

  *) The src/main/*.h header files have had #ifndef wrappers added to
     insulate them against duplicate calls if they get included through
     multiple paths (e.g., in .c files as well as other .h files).
     [Ken Coar]

  *) The libap routines now have a header file for their prototypes,
     src/ap/ap.h, to ease their use in non-httpd applications.  [Ken Coar]

  *) mod_autoindex with a plaintext header file would emit the <PRE>
     start-tag before the HTML preamble, rather than after the preamble
     but before the header file contents.  [John Van Essen <jve@gamers.org>]

     is used to read various types of files such as htaccess and
     htpasswd files.  [Marc Slemko]

  *) SECURITY: Ensure that the buffer returned by ht_time is always
     properly null terminated.  [Marc Slemko]

  *) The "Connection" header could be sent back with multiple "close"
     tokens.  Not an error, but a waste.

  *) mod_rewrite's RewriteLog should behave like mod_log_config, it
     shouldn't force hostname lookups.  [Dean Gaudet] PR#1684

  *) "basic" auth needs a case-insensitive comparison.
     [Ronald.Tschalaer@psi.ch] PR#1666

  *) For maximum portability, the environment passed to CGIs should
     only contain variables whose names match the regex
     /[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*/.  This is now enforced by stamping
     underscores over any character outside the regex.  This
     affects HTTP_* variables, in a way that should be backward
     compatible for all the standard headers; and affects variables
     set with SetEnv/BrowserMatch and similar directives.

  *) SECURITY: Numerous changes to mod_imap in a general cleanup
     including fixing a possible buffer overflow.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) WIN32: overhaul of multithreading code. Shutdowns are now graceful
     (connections are not dropped). Code can handle graceful restarts
     (but there is as yet no way to signal this to Apache). Various
     other cleanups. [Paul Sutton]

  *) The aplog_error changes specific to 1.3 introduced a buffer
     overrun in the (now legacy) log_printf function.  Fixed.
     [Dean Gaudet]

     [Ben Reser <breser@regnow.com>] PR#1366

  *) The bputc() macro was not properly integrated with the chunking
     code; in many cases modules using bputc() could cause completely
     bogus chunked output.  (Typically this will show up as problems
     with Internet Explorer 4.0 reading a page, but other browsers
     having no problem.) [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Create LARGE_WRITE_THRESHOLD define which determines how many
     bytes have to be supplied to bwrite() before it will consider
     doing a writev() to assemble multiple buffers in one system
     call.  This is critical for modules such as mod_include,
     mod_autoindex, mod_php3 which all use bputc()/bputs() of smaller
     strings in some cases.  The result would be extra effort
     setting up writev(), and in many cases extra effort building
     chunks.  The default is 31, it can be overriden at compile
     time. [Dean Gaudet]

  *) ap_slack() moved out of main/util.c into ap/ap_slack.c as part of
     the libap consolidation work.  [Ken Coar]

  *) ap_snprintf() with a len of 0 behaved like sprintf().  This is not
     useful, and isn't what the standards require.  Now it returns 0

  *) It was necessary to distinguish between resources which are
     allocated in the parent, for cleanup in the parent, and resources
     which are allocated in each child, for cleanup in each child.
     A new pool was created which is passed to the module child_init
     and child_exit functions; modules are free to register per-child
     cleanups there.  This fixes a bug with reliable piped logs.

  *) Complete rewrite ;-) of mod_rewrite's URL rewriting engine:
     Now the rewriting engine (the heart of mod_rewrite) is organized more
     straight-forward, first time well documented and reduced to the really
     essential parts. All redundant cases were stripped off and processing now
     is the same for both per-server and per-directory context with only a
     minimum difference (the prefix stripping in per-dir context). As a
     side-effect some subtle restrictions and two recently discovered problems
     are gone: Wrong escaping of QUERY_STRING on redirects in per-directory
     context and restrictions on the substitution URL on redirects.
     Additionally some minor source cleanups were done.

  *) TestCompile was not passing $LIBS [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Makefile.tmpl was not using $CFLAGS in the link phase. 
     [Martin Kraemer]

  *) Add debugging code to alloc.c.  Defining ALLOC_DEBUG provides a
     rudimentary memory debugger which can be used on live servers with
     low impact -- it sets all allocated and freed memory bytes to 0xa5.
     Defining ALLOC_USE_MALLOC will cause the alloc code to use malloc()
     and free() for each object.  This is far more expensive and should
     only be used for testing with tools such as Electric Fence and
     Purify.  See main/alloc.c for more details.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Configure uses a sh trap and didn't set its exitcode properly.
     [Dean Gaudet] PR#1159

  *) Yet another vhost revamp.  Add the NameVirtualHost directive which
     explicitly lists the ip:port pairs that are to be used for name-vhosts.
     From a given ip:port, regardless what the Host: header is, you can
     only reach the vhosts defined on that ip:port.  The precedence of
     vhosts was reversed to match other precedences in the config --
     the earlier vhosts override the later vhosts.  All vhost matching was
     moved into http_vhost.[ch].  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) ap_inline can be used to force inlining.  GNUC __attribute__() can
     be used for whatever reason is appropriate (i.e. format() warnings
     for printf style functions).  Both are enabled only with
     gcc >= 2.7.x (so that we have fewer support issues with older
     versions).  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Fix support for Proxy Authentication (we were testing the response

  *) When booting, apache will now detach itself from stdin, stdout,
     and stderr.  stderr will not be detached until after the config
     files have been read so you will be able to see initial error
     messages.  After that all errors are logged in the error_log.
     This makes it more convenient to start apache via rsh, ssh,
     or crontabs.  [Dean Gaudet] PR#523

  *) mod_proxy was sending HTTP/1.1 responses to ftp requests by mistake.
     Also removed the auto-generated link to www.apache.org that was the
     source of so many misdirected bug reports.  [Roy Fielding, Marc Slemko]

  *) send_fb would not detect aborted connections in some situations.
     [Dean Gaudet]

  *) mod_include would use uninitialized data when parsing certain
     expressions involving && and ||. [Brian Slesinsky] PR#1139

  *) mod_imap should only handle GET methods.  [Jay Bloodworth]

  *) suexec.c wouldn't build without -DLOG_EXEC. [Jason A. Dour]

  *) mod_autoindex improperly counted &escapes; as more than one
     character in the description.  It also improperly truncated
     descriptions that were exactly the maximum length.
     [Martin Kraemer]

  *) RedirectMatch was not properly escaping the result (PR#1155).  Also
     "RedirectMatch /advertiser/(.*) $1" is now permitted.
     [Dean Gaudet]

  *) mod_include now uses symbolic names to check for request success
     and return HTTP errors, and correctly handles all types of
     redirections (previously it only did temporary redirect correctly).
     [Ken Coar, Roy Fielding]

  *) mod_userdir was modifying r->finfo in cases where it wasn't setting
     r->filename.  Since those two are meant to be in sync with each other
     this is a bug.  ["Paul B. Henson" <henson@intranet.csupomona.edu>]

  *) PORT: Support Unisys SVR4, whose uname returns mostly useless data.
     ["Kaufman, Steven E" <Steven.Kaufman@unisys.com>]

  *) Inetd mode (which is buggy) uses timeouts without having setup the
     jmpbuffer. [Dean Gaudet] PR#1064

  *) Work around problem under Linux where a child will start looping
     reporting a select error over and over.
     [Rick Franchuk <rickf@transpect.net>] PR#1107, 987, 588

  *) Fixed error in proxy_util.c when looping through multiple host IP
     addresses. [Lars Eilebrecht] PR#974

  *) If BUFFERED_LOGS is defined then mod_log_config will do atomic
     buffered writes -- that is, it will buffer up to PIPE_BUF (i.e. 4k)
     bytes before writing, but it will never split a log entry across a
     buffer boundary.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) API: the short_score record has been split into two pieces, one which
     the parent writes on, and one which the child writes on.  As part of
     this change the get_scoreboard_info() function was removed, and
     scoreboard_image was exported.  This change fixes a race condition
     in file based scoreboard systems, and speeds up changes involving the
     scoreboard in earlier 1.3 development.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) API: New register_other_child() API (see http_main.h) which allows
     modules to register children with the parent for maintenance.  It
     is disabled by defining NO_OTHER_CHILD.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) API: New piped_log API (see http_log.h) which implements piped logs,
     and will use register_other_child to implement reliable piped logs
     when it is available.  The reliable piped logs part can be disabled
     by defining NO_RELIABLE_PIPED_LOGS.  At the moment reliable piped
     logs is only available on Unix. [Dean Gaudet]

  *) API: set_last_modified() broken into set_last_modified(), set_etag(), and
     meets_conditions().  This allows conditional HTTP selection to be
     handled separately from the storing of the header fields, and provides
     the ability for CGIs to set their own ETags for conditional checking.
     [Ken Coar, Roy Fielding]  PR#895

  *) Changes to mod_log_config to allow naming of format strings.
     Format nicknames are defined with "LogFormat fmt nickname", and can
     be used with "LogFormat nickname" and "CustomLog logtarget nickname".
     [Ken Coar]

  *) New module, "mod_speling", which can help find files even when 
     the URL is slightly misspelled. [Martin Kraemer, Alexei Kosut]

  *) API: New function child_terminate() triggers the child process to
     exit, while allowing the child finish what it needs to for the
     current request first.  
     [Doug MacEachern, Alexei Kosut]

  *) Windows now defaults to using full status reports with mod_status.
     [Alexei Kosut] PR #1094

  *) *Really* disable all mod_rewrite operations if the engine is off.
     Some things (like RewriteMaps) were checked/performed even if they
     weren't supposed to be.  [Ken Coar] PR #991

  *) Implement a new timer scheme which eliminates the need to call alarm() all
     the time.  Instead a counter in the scoreboard for each child is used to
     show when the child has made forward progress.  The parent samples this
     counter every scoreboard maintenance cycle, and issues SIGALRM if no
     progress has been made in the timeout period.  This reduces the static
     request best-case syscall count to 22 from 29.  This scheme is only
     used by systems with memory-based scoreboards.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) The proxy now properly handles CONNECT requests which are sent
     to proxy servers when using ProxyRemote.  [Marc Slemko] PR#1024

  *) A script called apachectl has been added to the support 
     directory.  This script allows you to do things such as 
     "apachectl start" and "apachectl restart" from the command
     line.  [Marc Slemko]

  *) Modules and core routines are now put into libraries, which
     simplifies the link line tremendously (among other advantages).
     [Paul Sutton]

  *) Some of the MD5 names defined in Apache have been renamed to have
     an `ap_' prefix to avoid conflicts with routines supplied by
     external libraries.  [Ken Coar]

  *) Removal of mod_auth_msql.c from the distribution. There are many
     other options for databases today. Rather than offer one option,
     offer none at this time. mod_auth_msql and other SQL database
     authentication modules can be found at the Apache Module Registry.
     http://modules.apache.org/ It would be nice to offer a generic
     mod_auth_sql option in the near future.

  *) PORT: BeOS support added [Alexei Kosut]

  *) Configure no longer accepts the -make option, since it creates
     Makefile on the fly based on Makefile.tmpl and Configuration.

  *) Apache now gracefully shuts down when it receives a SIGTERM, instead
     of forcibly killing off all its processes and exiting without
     cleaning up. [Alexei Kosut]

  *) API: A new field in the request_rec, r->mtime, has been added to
     avoid gratuitous parsing of date strings.  It is intended to hold
     the last-modified date of the resource (if applicable).  An
     update_mtime() routine has also been added to advance it if
     appropriate.  [Roy Fielding, Ken Coar]

  *) SECURITY: If a htaccess file can not be read due to bad permissions,
     deny access to the directory with a HTTP_FORBIDDEN.  The previous
     behavior was to ignore the htaccess file if it could not be read.
     This change may make some setups with unreadable htaccess files
     stop working.  [Marc Slemko] PR#817

  *) Add aplog_error() providing a mechanism to define levels of
     verbosity to the server error logging. This addition also provides
     the ability to log errors using syslogd. Error logging is configurable
     on a per-server basis using the LogLevel directive. Conversion
     of log_*() in progress. [Randy Terbush]

  *) Further enhance aplog_error() to not log filename, line number, and
     errno information when it isn't applicable. [Ken Coar, Dean Gaudet]

  *) WIN32: Canonicalise filenames under Win32. Short filenames are
     converted to long ones. Backslashes are converted to forward
     slashes. Case is converted to lower. Parts of URLs that do not
     correspond to files are left completely alone. [Ben Laurie]

  *) PORT: 2 new OSs added to the list of ports:
      Encore's UMAX V: Arieh Markel <amarkel@encore.com>
      Acorn RISCiX: Stephen Borrill <sborrill@xemplar.co.uk>

  *) Add the server version (SERVER_VERSION macro) to the "server
     configured and running" entry in the error_log.  Also build an
     object file at link-time that contains the current time
     (SERVER_BUILT global const char[]), and include that in the
     message.  [Ken Coar]

  *) Set r->headers_out when sending responses from the proxy.
     This fixes things such as the logging of headers sent from
     the proxy.  [Marc Slemko] PR#659

  *) support/httpd_monitor is no longer distributed because the 
     scoreboard should not be file based if at all possible. Use
     mod_status to see current server snapshot.

  *) (set_file_slot): New function, allowing auth directives to be
     independent of the server root, so the server documents can be
     moved to a different directory or machine more easily.
     [David J. MacKenzie]

  *) If no TransferLog is given explicitly, decline
     to log.  This supports coexistence with other logging modules,
     such as the custom one that UUNET uses. [David J. MacKenzie]

  *) Check for titles in server-parsed HTML files.
     Ignore leading newlines and returns in titles.  The old behavior
     of replacing a newline after <title> with a space causes the
     title to be misaligned in the listing. [David J. MacKenzie]

  *) Change mod_cern_meta to be configurable on a per-directory basis.
     [David J. MacKenzie]

  *) Add 'Include' directive to allow inclusion of configuration
     files within configuration files. [Randy Terbush]

  *) Proxy errors on connect() are logged to the error_log (nothing
     new); now they include the IP address and port that failed
     (*that's* new).   [Ken Coar, Marc Slemko] PR#352

  *) Various architectures now define USE_MMAP_FILES which causes
     the server to use mmap() for static files.  There are two
     compile-time tunables MMAP_THRESHOLD (minimum number of bytes
     required to use mmap(), default is 0), and MMAP_SEGMENT_SIZE (maximum
     number of bytes written in one cycle from a single mmap()d object,
     default 32768).  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) API: Added post_read_request API phase which is run right after reading
     the request from a client, or right after an internal redirect.  It is
     useful for modules setting environment variables that depend only on
     the headers/contents of the request.  It does not run during subrequests
     because subrequests inherit pretty much everything from the main
     request. [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Added mod_unique_id which is used to generate a unique identifier for
     each hit, available in the environment variable UNIQUE_ID.
     [Dean Gaudet]

  *) init_modules is now called after the error logs have been opened.  This
     allows modules to emit information messages into the error logs.
     [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Fixed proxy-pass-through feature of mod_rewrite; Added error logging
     information for case where proxy module is not available. [Marc Slemko]

  *) PORT: Apache has need for mutexes to serialize its children around
     accept.  In prior versions either fcntl file locking or flock file
     locking were used.  The method is chosen by the definition of
     USE_xxx_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT in conf.h.  xxx is FCNTL for fcntl(),
     and FLOCK for flock().  New options have been added:
        - SYSVSEM to use System V style semaphores
        - PTHREAD to use POSIX threads (appears to work on Solaris only)
        - USLOCK to use IRIX uslock
     Based on timing various techniques, the following changes were made
     to the defaults:
        - Linux 2.x uses flock instead of fcntl
        - Solaris 2.x uses pthreads
        - IRIX uses SysV semaphores -- however multiprocessor IRIX boxes
          work far faster if you -DUSE_USLOCK_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT
     [Dean Gaudet, Pierre-Yves Kerembellec <Pierre-Yves.Kerembellec@vtcom.fr>,
     Martijn Koster <m.koster@pobox.com>]

  *) PORT: The semantics of accept/select make it very desirable to use
     mutexes to serialize accept when multiple Listens are in use.  But
     in the case where only a single socket is open it is sometimes
     redundant to serialize accept().  Not all unixes do a good job with
     potentially dozens of children blocked on accept() on the same
     socket.  It's now possible to define SINGLE_LISTEN_UNSERIALIZED_ACCEPT and
     the server will avoid serialization when listening on only one socket,
     and use serialization when listening on multiple sockets.
     [Dean Gaudet] PR#467

  *) Configure changes: TestLib replaced by TestCompile, which has
     some additional capability (such as doing a sanity check of
     the compiler and flags selected); the version of Solaris is now
     available via the #define value of SOLARIS2; IRIX n32bit libs
     now supported and selectable by new Configuration Rule: IRIXN32;
     We no longer default to -O2 optimization.  [Jim Jagielski]

  *) Updated Configure: Configuration now uses AddModule to specify
     module source or binary file location, relative to src directory.
     Modules can be dropped into modules/extra, or in their own 
     directory, and modules can come with a Makefile or Configure can 
     create one.  Modules can add compiler or library information to 
     generated Makefiles. [Paul Sutton]

  *) Source core re-organisation: distributed modules are now in 
     modules/standard. All other source code is in main. OS-specific
     code is in os/{unix,emx,win32} directories. [Paul Sutton]

  *) mod_browser has been removed, since it's replaced by mod_setenvif.
     [Ken Coar]

  *) Fix another long-standing bug in sub_req_lookup_file where it would
     happily skip past access checks on subdirectories looked up with
     relative paths.  (It's used by mod_dir, mod_negotiation,
     and mod_include.) [Dean Gaudet]

  *) directory_walk optimization to reduce an O(N*M) loop to O(N+M) where
     N is the number of <Directory> sections, and M is the number of
     components in the filename of an object.

     To achieve this optimization the following config changes were made:
        - Wildcards (* and ?, not the regex forms) in <Directory>s,
          <Files>s, and <Location>s now treat a slash as a special
          character.  For example "/home/*/public_html" previously would
          match "/home/a/andrew/public_html", now it only matches things
          like "/home/bob/public_html".  This mimics /bin/sh behaviour.
        - It's possible now to use [] wildcarding in <Directory>, <Files>
          or <Location>.
        - Regex <Directory>s are applied after all non-regex <Directory>s.

    [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Fix a bug introduced in 1.3a1 directory_walk regarding .htaccess files
     and corrupted paths.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Enhanced and cleaned up the URL rewriting engine of mod_rewrite:
     First the grouped parts of RewriteRule pattern matches (parenthesis!) can
     be accessed now via backreferences $1..$9 in RewriteConds test-against
     strings in addition to RewriteRules subst string. Second the grouped
     parts of RewriteCond pattern matches (parenthesis!) can be accessed now
     via backreferences %1..%9 both in following RewriteCond test-against
     strings and RewriteRules subst string. This provides maximum flexibility
     through the use of backreferences.
     Additionally the rewriting engine was cleaned up by putting common
     code to the new expand_backrefs_inbuffer() function. 
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) When merging the main server's <Directory> and <Location> sections into
     a vhost, put the main server's first and the vhost's second.  Otherwise
     the vhost can't override the main server.  [Dean Gaudet] PR#717

  *) The <Directory> code would merge and re-merge the same section after
     a match was found, possibly causing problems with some modules.
     [Dean Gaudet]

  *) ip-based vhosts are stored and queried using a hashing function, which
     has been shown to improve performance on servers with many ip-vhosts.
     Some other changes had to be made to accommodate this:
        - the * address for vhosts now behaves like _default_
        - the matching process now is:
            - match an ip-vhost directly via hash (possibly matches main
              server)
            - if that fails, just pretend it matched the main server
            - if so far only the main server has been matched, perform
              name-based lookups (ServerName, ServerAlias, ServerPath)
              *only on name-based vhosts*
            - if they fail, look for _default_ vhosts
     [Dean Gaudet, Dave Hankins <dhankins@sugarat.net>]

  *) dbmmanage overhaul:
     - merge dbmmanage and dbmmanage.new functionality, remove dbmmanage.new 
     - tie() to AnyDBM_File which will use one of DB_File, NDBM_File or
       GDBM_File (-ldb, -lndbm, -lgdbm) (trying each in that order)
     - provide better seed for rand
     - prompt for password as per getpass(3) (turn off echo, read from
       /dev/tty, etc.)
     - use "newstyle" crypt based on $Config{osname} ($^O)
     - will not add a user if already in database, use new `update' command
       instead
     - added `check' command to check a users' password
     - added `import' command to convert existing password text-files or 
       dbm files exported with `view'
     - more descriptive usage, general cleanup, 'use strict' clean, etc.
     [Doug MacEachern]

  *) Added psocket() which is a pool form of socket(), various places within
     the proxy weren't properly blocking alarms while registering the cleanup
     for its sockets.  bclose() now uses pclose() and pclosesocket().  There
     was a bug where the client socket was being close()d twice due a still
     registered cleanup.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) A few cleanups were made to reduce time(), getpid(), and signal() calls.
     [Dean Gaudet]

  *) PORT: AIX >= 4.2 requires -lm due to libc changes.
     [Jason Venner <jason@idiom.com>] PR#667

  *) Enable ``=""'' for RewriteCond directives to match against
     the empty string. This is the preferred way instead of ``^$''.
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Fixed an infinite loop in mod_imap for references above the server root
     [Dean Gaudet] PR#748

  *) mod_proxy now has a ReceiveBufferSize directive, similar to
     SendBufferSize, so that the TCP window can be set appropriately
     for LFNs. [Phillip A. Prindeville]

  *) mod_browser has been replaced by the more general mod_setenvif
     (courtesy of Paul Sutton).  BrowserMatch* directives are still
     available, but are now joined by SetEnvIf*, UnSetEnvIf*, and
     UnSetEnvIfZero directives.  [Ken Coar]

  *) "HostnameLookups double" forces double-reverse DNS to succeed in
     order for remote_host to be set (for logging, or for the env var
     REMOTE_HOST).  The old define MAXIMUM_DNS has been deprecated.
     [Dean Gaudet]

  *) mod_access overhaul:
     - Now understands network/netmask syntax (i.e.  10.1.0.0/255.255.0.0)
       and cidr syntax (i.e. 10.1.0.0/16).  PR#762
     - Critical path was sped up by pre-computing a few things at config time.
     - The undocumented syntax "allow user-agents" was removed,
       the replacement is "allow from env=foobar" combined with mod_browser.
     - When used with hostnames it now forces a double-reverse lookup
       no matter what the directory settings are.  This double-reverse
       doesn't affect any of the other routines that use the remote
       hostname.  In particular it's still passed to CGIs and the log
       without the double-reverse check.  Related PR#860.
     [Dean Gaudet]

  *) When a large bwrite() occurs (larger than the internal buffer size),
     while there is already something in the buffer, apache will combine
     the large write and the buffer into a single writev().  (This is
     in anticipation of using mmap() for reading files.)
     [Dean Gaudet]

  *) In obscure cases where a partial socket write occurred while chunking,
     Apache would omit the chunk header/footer on the next block.  Cleaned
     up other bugs/inconsistencies in error conditions in buff.c.  Fixed
     a bug where a long pause in DNS lookups could cause the last packet
     of a response to be unduly delayed.  [Roy Fielding, Dean Gaudet]

  *) API: Added child_exit function to module structure.  This is called
     once per "heavy-weight process" just before a server child exit()'s 
     e.g. when max_requests_per_child is reached, etc.
     [Doug MacEachern, Dean Gaudet]

  *) mod_include cleanup showed that handle_else was being used to handle
     endif.  It didn't cause problems, but it was cleaned up too.
     [Howard Fear]

  *) mod_cern_meta would attempt to find meta files for the directory itself
     in some cases, but not in others.  It now avoids it in all cases.
     [Dean Gaudet]

  *) mod_mime_magic would core dump if there was a decompression error.
     [Martin Kraemer <Martin.Kraemer@mch.sni.de>] PR#904

  *) PORT: some variants of DGUX require -lsocket -lnsl
     [Alexander L Jones <alex@systems-options.co.uk>] PR#732

  *) mod_autoindex now allows sorting of FancyIndexed directory listings
     by the various fields (name, size, et cetera), either in ascending
     or descending order.  Just click on the column header.  [Ken Coar]

  *) PORT: Various tweaks to eliminate pointer-int casting warnings on 64-bit
     CPUs like the Alpha.  Apache still stores ints in pointers, but that's
     the relatively safe direction.  [Dean Gaudet] PR#344

  *) PORT: QNX mmap() support for faster/more reliable scoreboard handling.
     [Igor N Kovalenko <infoh@mail.wplus.net>] PR#683

  *) child_main avoids an unneeded call to select() when there is only one
     listening socket.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) In the event that the server is starved for idle servers it will
     spawn 1, then 2, then 4, ..., then 32 servers each second,
     doubling each second.  It'll also give a warning in the errorlog
     since the most common reason for this is a poor StartServers
     setting.  The define MAX_SPAWN_RATE can be used to raise/lower
     the maximum.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Apache now provides an effectively unbuffered connection for
     CGI scripts.  This means that data will be sent to the client
     as soon as the CGI pauses or stops output; previously, Apache would
     buffer the output up to a fixed buffer size before sending, which
     could result in the user viewing an empty page until the CGI finished
     or output a complete buffer.  It is no longer necessary to use an
     "nph-" CGI to get unbuffered output.  Given that most CGIs are written
     in a language that by default does buffering (e.g. perl) this
     shouldn't have a detrimental effect on performance.

     "nph-" CGIs, which formerly provided a direct socket to the client
     without any server post-processing, were not fully compatible with
     HTTP/1.1 or SSL support.  As such they would have had to implement
     the transport details, such as encryption or chunking, in order
     to work properly in certain situations.  Now, the only difference
     between nph and non-nph scripts is "non-parsed headers".
     [Dean Gaudet, Sameer Parekh, Roy Fielding]

  *) If a BUFF is switched from buffered to unbuffered reading the first
     bread() will return whatever remained in the buffer prior to the
     switch. [Dean Gaudet]

Changes with Apache 1.3a1

  *) Added another Configure helper script: TestLib. It determines
     if a specified library exists.  [Jim Jagielski]

  *) PORT: Allow for use of n32bit libraries under IRIX 6.x
     [derived from patch from Jeff Hayes <jhayes@aw.sgi.com>]
     PR#721

  *) PORT: Some architectures use size_t for various lengths in network
     functions such as accept(), and getsockname().  The definition
     NET_SIZE_T is used to control this. [Dean Gaudet]

  *) PORT: Linux: Attempt to detect glibc based systems and include crypt.h
     and -lcrypt.  Test for various db libraries (dbm, ndbm, db) when
     mod_auth_dbm or mod_auth_db are included.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) PORT: QNX doesn't have initgroups() which support/suexec.c uses.
     [Igor N Kovalenko <infoh@mail.wplus.net>]

  *) "force-response-1.0" now only applies to requests which are HTTP/1.0 to
     begin with.  "nokeepalive" now works for HTTP/1.1 clients.  Added
     "downgrade-1.0" which causes Apache to pretend it received a 1.0.
     [Dean Gaudet] related PR#875

  *) API: Correct child_init() slot declaration from int to void, to
     match the init() declaration.  Update mod_example to use the new
     hook.  [Ken Coar]

  *) added transport handle slot (t_handle) to the BUFF structure
     [Doug MacEachern]

  *) get_client_block() returns wrong length if policy is
     REQUEST_CHUNKED_DECHUNK.
     [Kenichi Hori <ken@d2.bs1.fc.nec.co.jp>] PR#815

  *) AddModuleInfo directive for mod_info which allows you to annotate
     the output of mod_info.  ["Lou D. Langholtz" <ldl@usi.utah.edu>]

  *) Added NoProxy directive to avoid using ProxyRemote for selected
     addresses.  Added ProxyDomain directive to cause unqualified
     names to be qualified by redirection.
     [Martin Kraemer <Martin.Kraemer@mch.sni.de>]

  *) Support Proxy Authentication, and don't pass the Proxy-Authorize
     header to the remote host in the proxy. [Sameer Parekh and
     Wallace]

  *) Upgraded mod_rewrite from 3.0.6+ to latest officially available version
     3.0.9. This upgrade includes: fixed deadlooping on rewriting to same
     URLs, fixed rewritelog(), fixed forced response code handling on
     redirects from within .htaccess files, disabled pipe locking under
     braindead SunOS 4.1.x, allow env variables to be set even on rules with
     no substitution, bugfixed situations where HostnameLookups is off, made
     mod_rewrite more thread-safe for NT port and fixed problem when creating
     an empty query string via "xxx?".
         This update also removes the copyright of Ralf S. Engelschall,
     i.e. now mod_rewrite no longer has a shared copyright. Instead is is
     exclusively copyrighted by the Apache Group now. This happened because
     the author now has gifted mod_rewrite exclusively to the Apache Group and 
     no longer maintains an external version.
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) API: Added child_init function to module structure.  This is called
     once per "heavy-weight process" before any requests are handled.
     See http_config.h for more details.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Anonymous_LogEmail was logging on each subrequest.
     [Dean Gaudet] PR#421, 868

  *) API: Added is_initial_req() which tests if the request being
     processed is the initial request, or a subrequest.
     [Doug MacEachern]

  *) Extended SSI (mod_include) now handles additional relops for
     string comparisons (<, >, <=, and >=).  [Bruno Wolff III] PR#41

  *) Configure fixed to correctly propagate user-selected options and
     settings (such as CC and OPTIM) to Makefiles other than
     src/Makefile (notably support/Makefile).  [Ken Coar] PR#666, #834

  *) IndexOptions SuppressHTMLPreamble now causes the actual HTML of
     directory indices to start with the contents of the HeaderName file
     if there is one.  If there isn't one, the behaviour is unchanged.
     [Ken Coar, Roy Fielding, Andrey A. Chernov]

  *) WIN32: Modules can now be dynamically loaded DLLs using the
     LoadModule/LoadFile directives. Note that module DLLs must be
     compiled with the multithreaded DLL version of the runtime library.
     [Alexei Kosut and Ben Laurie]

  *) Automatic indexing removed from mod_dir and placed into mod_autoindex.
     This allows the admin to completely remove automatic indexing
     from the server, while still supporting the basic functions of
     trailing-slash redirects and DirectoryIndex files.  Note that if
     you're carrying over an old Configuration file and you use directory
     indexing then you'll want to add:

     Module autoindex_module    mod_autoindex.o

     before mod_dir in your Configuration.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) popendir/pclosedir created to properly protect directory scanning.
     [Dean Gaudet] PR#525

  *) AliasMatch, ScriptAliasMatch and RedirectMatch directives added,
     giving regex support to mod_alias. <DirectoryMatch>, <LocationMatch>
     and <FilesMatch> sections added to succeed <DirectoryMatch ~>, etc...
     [Alexei Kosut]

  *) The AccessFileName directive can now take more than one filename.
     ["Lou D. Langholtz" <ldl@usi.utah.edu>]

  *) The new mod_mime_magic can be used to "magically" determine the type
     of a file if the extension is unknown.  Based on the unix file(1)
     command.  [Ian Kluft <ikluft@cisco.com>]

  *) We now determine and display the time spent processing a
     request if desired.  [Jim Jagielski]

  *) mod_status: PID field of "dead" child slots no longer displays
     main httpd process's PID.  [Jim Jagielski]

  *) Makefile.nt added - to build all the bits from the command line:
        nmake -f Makefile.nt
         Doesn't yet work properly. [Ben Laurie]

  *) Default text of 404 error is now "Not Found" rather than the
     potentially misleading "File Not Found".  [Ken Coar]

  *) CONFIG: "HostnameLookups" now defaults to off because it is far better
     for the net if we require people that actually need this data to
     enable it.  [Linus Torvalds]

  *) directory_walk() is an expensive function, keep a little more state to
     avoid needless string counting.  Add two new functions make_dirstr_parent
     and make_dirstr_prefix which replace all existing uses of make_dirstr.
     The new functions are a little less general than make_dirstr, but
     work more efficiently (less memory, less string counting).
     [Dean Gaudet]

  *) EXTRA_LFLAGS was changed to EXTRA_LDFLAGS (and LFLAGS was changed
     to LDFLAGS) to avoid complications with lex rules in make files.
     [Dean Gaudet] PR#372

  *) run_method optimized to avoid needless scanning over NULLs in the
     module list.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Revamp of (unix) scoreboard management code such that it avoids
     unnecessary traversals of the scoreboard on each hit.  This is
     particularly important for high volume sites with a large
     HARD_SERVER_LIMIT.  Some of the previous operations were O(n^2),
     and are now O(n).  See also SCOREBOARD_MAINTENANCE_INTERVAL in
     httpd.h. [Dean Gaudet]

  *) In configurations using multiple Listen statements it was possible for
     busy sockets to starve other sockets of service.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Added hook so standalone_main can be replaced at compile time
     (define STANDALONE_MAIN)
     [Doug MacEachern]

  *) Lowest-level read/write functions in buff.c will be replaced with
     the SFIO library calls sfread/sfwrite if B_SFIO is defined at
     compile time.  The default sfio discipline will behave as apache
     would without sfio compiled in.
     [Doug MacEachern]

  *) Enhance UserDir directive (mod_userdir) to accept a list of
     usernames for the 'disable' keyword, and add 'enable user...' to
     selectively *en*able userdirs if they're globally disabled.
     [Ken Coar]

  *) If NETSCAPE_DBM_COMPAT is defined in EXTRA_CFLAGS then Apache
     will work with Netscape dbm files.  (dbmmanage will probably not
     work however.) [Alexander Spohr <aspohr@netmatic.com>] PR#444

  *) Add a ListenBacklog directive to control the backlog parameter
     passed to listen().  Also change the default to 511 from 512.
     [Marc Slemko]

  *) API: A new handler response DONE which informs apache that the
     request has been handled and it can finish off quickly, similar to
     how it handles errors. [Rob Hartill]

  *) Turn off chunked encoding after sending terminating chunk/footer
     so that we can't do it twice by accident. [Roy Fielding]

  *) mod_expire also issues Cache-Control: max-age headers.
     [Rob Hartill]

  *) API: Added kill_only_once option for free_proc_chain so that it won't
     aggressively try to kill off specific children.  For fastcgi.
     [Stanley Gambarin <gambarin@OpenMarket.com>]

  *) mod_auth deals with extra ':' delimited fields.  [Marc Slemko]

  *) Added IconHeight and IconWidth to mod_dir's IndexOptions directive.
     When used together, these cause mod_dir to emit HEIGHT and WIDTH
     attributes in the FancyIndexing IMG tags.  [Ken Coar]

  *) PORT: Sequent and SONY NEWS-OS support added.  [Jim Jagielski]

  *) PORT: Added Windows NT support
     [Ben Laurie and Ambarish Malpani <ambarish@valicert.com>]

Changes with Apache 1.2.6

  *) mod_include when using XBitHack Full would send ETags in addition to
     sending Last-Modifieds.  This is incorrect HTTP/1.1 behaviour.
     [Dean Gaudet] PR#1133

  *) SECURITY: When a client connects to a particular port/addr, and
     gives a Host: header ensure that the virtual host requested can
     actually be reached via that port/addr.  [Ed Korthof <ed@organic.com>]

  *) Support virtual hosts with wildcard port and/or multiple ports
     properly.  [Ed Korthof <ed@organic.com>]

  *) Fixed some case-sensitivity issues according to RFC2068.
     [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Set r->allowed properly in mod_asis.c, mod_dir.c, mod_info.c,
     and mod_include.c.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Variable 'cwd' was being used pointlessly before being set.
     [Ken Coar] PR#1738

  *) SIGURG doesn't exist on all platforms.
     [Mark Andrew Heinrich <heinrich@tinderbox.Stanford.EDU>]

  *) When an error occurs during a POST, or other operation with a
     request body, the body has to be read from the net before allowing
     a keepalive session to continue.  [Roy Fielding] PR#1399

  *) When an error occurs in fcntl() locking suggest the user look up
     the docs for LockFile.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) table_set() and table_unset() did not deal correctly with
     multiple occurrences of the same key. [Stephen Scheck
     <sscheck@infonex.net>, Ben Laurie] PR#1604

  *) send_fd_length() did not calculate total_bytes_sent properly in error
     cases.  [Ben Reser <breser@regnow.com>] PR#1366

  *) r->connection->user was allocated in the wrong pool causing corruption
     in some cases when used with mod_cern_meta.  [Dean Gaudet] PR#1500

  *) mod_proxy was sending HTTP/1.1 responses to ftp requests by mistake.
     Also removed the auto-generated link to www.apache.org that was the
     source of so many misdirected bug reports.  [Roy Fielding, Marc Slemko]

  *) Multiple "close" tokens may have been set in the "Connection"
     header, not an error, but a waste.
     [Ronald.Tschalaer@psi.ch] PR#1683

  *) "basic" and "digest" auth tokens should be tested case-insensitive.
     [Ronald.Tschalaer@psi.ch] PR#1599, PR#1666

  *) It appears the "257th byte" bug (see
     htdocs/manual/misc/known_client_problems.html#257th-byte) can happen
     at the 256th byte as well.  Fixed.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) mod_rewrite would not handle %3f properly in some situations.
     [Ralf Engelschall]

  *) Apache could generate improperly chunked HTTP/1.1 responses when
     the bputc() or rputc() functions were used by modules (such as
     mod_include).  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) #ifdef wrap a few #defines in httpd.h to make life easier on
     some ports.  [Ralf Engelschall]

  *) Fix MPE compilation error in mod_usertrack.c.  [Mark Bixby]

  *) Quote CC='$(CC)' to improve recurse make calls.  [Martin Kraemer]

  *) Avoid B_ERROR redeclaration on sysvr4 systems.  [Martin Kraemer]

Changes with Apache 1.2.5

  *) SECURITY: Fix a possible buffer overflow in logresolve.  This is
     only an issue on systems without a MAXDNAME define or where 
     the resolver returns domain names longer than MAXDNAME.  [Marc Slemko]

  *) Fix an improper length in an ap_snprintf call in proxy_date_canon().
     [Marc Slemko]

  *) Fix core dump in the ftp proxy when reading incorrectly formatted
     directory listings.  [Marc Slemko]

  *) SECURITY: Fix possible minor buffer overflow in the proxy cache.
     [Marc Slemko]

  *) SECURITY: Eliminate possible buffer overflow in cfg_getline, which
     is used to read various types of files such as htaccess and 
     htpasswd files.  [Marc Slemko]

  *) SECURITY: Ensure that the buffer returned by ht_time is always
     properly null terminated.  [Marc Slemko]

  *) SECURITY: General mod_include cleanup, including fixing several
     possible buffer overflows and a possible infinite loop.  This cleanup
     was done against 1.3 code and then backported to 1.2, the result
     is a large difference (due to indentation cleanup in 1.3 code).
     Users interested in seeing a smaller set of relevant differences
     should consider comparing against src/modules/standard/mod_include.c
     from the 1.3b3 release.  Non-indentation changes to mod_include
     between 1.2 and 1.3 were minimal.  [Dean Gaudet, Marc Slemko]

  *) SECURITY: Numerous changes to mod_imap in a general cleanup
     including fixing a possible buffer overflow.  This cleanup also
     was done with 1.3 code as a basis, see the the previous note
     about mod_include.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) SECURITY: If a htaccess file can not be read due to bad 
     permissions, deny access to the directory with a HTTP_FORBIDDEN.  
     The previous behavior was to ignore the htaccess file if it could not
     be read.  This change may make some setups with unreadable
     htaccess files stop working.  PR#817  [Marc Slemko]

  *) SECURITY: no2slash() was O(n^2) in the length of the input.  
     Make it O(n).  This inefficiency could be used to mount a denial 
     of service attack against the Apache server.  Thanks to 
     Michal Zalewski <lcamtuf@boss.staszic.waw.pl> for reporting
     this.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) mod_include used uninitialized data for some uses of && and ||.
     [Brian Slesinsky <bslesins@wired.com>] PR#1139

  *) mod_imap should decline all non-GET methods.
     [Jay Bloodworth <jay@pathways.sde.state.sc.us>]

  *) suexec.c wouldn't build without -DLOG_EXEC. [Jason A. Dour]

  *) mod_userdir was modifying r->finfo in cases where it wasn't setting
     r->filename.  Since those two are meant to be in sync with each other
     this is a bug.  ["Paul B. Henson" <henson@intranet.csupomona.edu>]

  *) mod_include did not properly handle all possible redirects from sub-
     requests.  [Ken Coar]

  *) Inetd mode (which is buggy) uses timeouts without having setup the
     jmpbuffer. [Dean Gaudet] PR#1064

  *) Work around problem under Linux where a child will start looping
     reporting a select error over and over.
     [Rick Franchuk <rickf@transpect.net>] PR#1107

Changes with Apache 1.2.4

  *) The ProxyRemote change in 1.2.3 introduced a bug resulting in the proxy
     always making requests with the full-URI instead of just the URI path.
     [Marc Slemko, Roy Fielding]

  *) Add -lm for AIX versions >= 4.2 to allow Apache to link properly
     on this platform.  [Marc Slemko]

Changes with Apache 1.2.3

  *) The request to a remote proxy was mangled if it was generated as the
     result of a ProxyPass directive. URL schemes other than http:// were not
     supported when ProxyRemote was used. PR#260, PR#656, PR#699, PR#713,
     PR#812 [Lars Eilebrecht]

  *) Fixed proxy-pass-through feature of mod_rewrite; Added error logging
     information for case where proxy module is not available. [Marc Slemko]

  *) Force proxy to always respond as HTTP/1.0, which it was failing to
     do for errors and cached responses.  [Roy Fielding]

  *) PORT: Improved support for ConvexOS 11.  [Jeff Venters]

Changes with Apache 1.2.2 [not released]

  *) Fixed another long-standing bug in sub_req_lookup_file where it would
     happily skip past access checks on subdirectories looked up with relative
     paths.  (It's used by mod_dir, mod_negotiation, and mod_include.)
     [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Add lockfile name to error message printed out when
     USE_FLOCK_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT is defined.
     [Marc Slemko]

  *) Enhanced the chunking and error handling inside the buffer functions.
     [Dean Gaudet, Roy Fielding]

  *) When merging the main server's <Directory> and <Location> sections into
     a vhost, put the main server's first and the vhost's second.  Otherwise
     the vhost can't override the main server.  [Dean Gaudet] PR#717

  *) The <Directory> code would merge and re-merge the same section after
     a match was found, possibly causing problems with some modules.
     [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Fixed an infinite loop in mod_imap for references above the server root.
     [Dean Gaudet] PR#748

  *) mod_include cleanup showed that handle_else was being used to handle
     endif.  It didn't cause problems, but it was cleaned up too.
     [Howard Fear]

  *) Last official synchronization of mod_rewrite with author version (because
     mod_rewrite is now directly developed by the author at the Apache Group):
     o added diff between mod_rewrite 3.0.6+ and 3.0.9
       minus WIN32/NT stuff, but plus copyright removement.
       In detail:
       - workaround for detecting infinite rewriting loops
       - fixed setting of env vars when "-" is used as subst string
       - fixed forced response code on redirects (PR#777)
       - fixed cases where r->args is ""
       - kludge to disable locking on pipes under braindead SunOS
       - fix for rewritelog in cases where remote hostname is unknown
       - fixed totally damaged request_rec walk-back loop
     o remove static from local data and add static to global ones.
     o replaced ugly proxy finding stuff by simple
       find_linked_module("mod_proxy") call.
     o added missing negation char on rewritelog()
     o fixed a few comment typos
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Anonymous_LogEmail was logging on each subrequest.
     [Dean Gaudet] PR#421, PR#868

  *) "force-response-1.0" now only applies to requests which are HTTP/1.0 to
     begin with.  "nokeepalive" now works for HTTP/1.1 clients.  Added
     "downgrade-1.0" which causes Apache to pretend it received a 1.0.
     Additionally mod_browser now triggers during translate_name to workaround
     a deficiency in the header_parse phase.
     [Dean Gaudet] PR#875

  *) get_client_block() returns wrong length if policy is 
     REQUEST_CHUNKED_DECHUNK.
     [Kenichi Hori <ken@d2.bs1.fc.nec.co.jp>] PR#815

  *) Properly treat <files> container like other containers in mod_info.
     [Marc Slemko] PR#848

  *) The proxy didn't treat the "Host:" keyword of the host header as case-
     insensitive.  The proxy would corrupt the first line of a response from
     an HTTP/0.9 server.  [Kenichi Hori <ken@d2.bs1.fc.nec.co.jp>] PR#813,814

  *) mod_include would log some bogus values occasionally.
     [Skip Montanaro <skip@calendar.com>, Marc Slemko] PR#797

  *) PORT: The slack fd changes in 1.2.1 introduced a problem with SIGHUP
     under Solaris 2.x (up through 2.5.1).  It has been fixed.
     [Dean Gaudet] PR#832

  *) API: In HTTP/1.1, whether or not a request message contains a body
     is independent of the request method and based solely on the presence
     of a Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding.  Therefore, our default
     handlers need to be prepared to read a body even if they don't know
     what to do with it; otherwise, the body would be mistaken for the
     next request on a persistent connection.  discard_request_body()
     has been added to take care of that.  [Roy Fielding] PR#378

  *) API: Symbol APACHE_RELEASE provides a numeric form of the Apache
     release version number, such that it always increases along the
     same lines as our source code branching.  [Roy Fielding]

  *) Minor oversight on multiple variants fixed.  [Paul Sutton] PR#94

Changes with Apache 1.2.1

  *) SECURITY: Don't serve file system objects unless they are plain files,
     symlinks, or directories.  This prevents local users from using pipes
     or named sockets to invoke programs for an extremely crude form of
     CGI.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) SECURITY: HeaderName and ReadmeName were settable in .htaccess and
     could contain "../" allowing a local user to "publish" any file on
     the system.  No slashes are allowed now.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) SECURITY: It was possible to violate the symlink Options using mod_dir
     (headers, readmes, titles), mod_negotiation (type maps), or
     mod_cern_meta (meta files).  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) SECURITY: Apache will refuse to run as "User root" unless
     BIG_SECURITY_HOLE is defined at compile time.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) CONFIG: If a symlink pointed to a directory then it would be disallowed
     if it contained a .htaccess disallowing symlinks.  This is contrary
     to the rule that symlink permissions are tested with the symlink
     options of the parent directory.  [Dean Gaudet] PR#353

  *) CONFIG: The LockFile directive can be used to place the serializing
     lockfile in any location.  It previously defaulted to /usr/tmp/htlock.
     [Somehow it took four of us: Randy Terbush, Jim Jagielski, Dean Gaudet,
     Marc Slemko]

  *) Request processing now retains state of whether or not the request
     body has been read, so that internal redirects and subrequests will
     not try to read it twice (and block). [Roy Fielding]

  *) Add a placeholder in modules/Makefile to avoid errors with certain
     makes. [Marc Slemko]

  *) QUERY_STRING was unescaped in mod_include, it shouldn't be.
     [Dean Gaudet] PR#644

  *) mod_include was not properly changing the current directory.
     [Marc Slemko] PR#742

  *) Attempt to work around problems with third party libraries that do not
     handle high numbered descriptors (examples include bind, and
     solaris libc).  On all systems apache attempts to keep all permanent
     descriptors above 15 (called the low slack line).  Solaris users
     can also benefit from adding -DHIGH_SLACK_LINE=256 to EXTRA_CFLAGS
     which keeps all non-FILE * descriptors above 255.  On all systems
     this should make supporting large numbers of vhosts with many open
     log files more feasible.  If this causes trouble please report it,
     you can disable this workaround by adding -DNO_SLACK to EXTRA_CFLAGS.
     [Dean Gaudet] various PRs

  *) Related to the last entry, network sockets are now opened before
     log files are opened.  The only known case where this can cause
     problems is under Solaris with many virtualhosts and many Listen
     directives.  But using -DHIGH_SLACK_LINE=256 described above will
     work around this problem.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) USE_FLOCK_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT is now default for FreeBSD, A/UX, and
     SunOS 4.

  *) Improved unix error response logging.  [Marc Slemko]

  *) Update mod_rewrite from 3.0.5 to 3.0.6.  New ruleflag
     QSA=query_string_append.  Also fixed a nasty bug in per-dir context:
     when a URL http://... was used in conjunction with a special
     redirect flag, e.g. R=permanent, the permanent status was lost.
     [Ronald Tschalaer <Ronald.Tschalaer@psi.ch>, Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) If an object has multiple variants that are otherwise equal Apache
     would prefer the last listed variant rather than the first.

Changes with Apache 1.2

Changes with Apache 1.2b11

  *) Fixed open timestamp fd in proxy_cache.c [Chuck Murcko]

  *) Added undocumented perl SSI mechanism for -DUSE_PERL_SSI and mod_perl.
     [Doug MacEachern, Rob Hartill]

  *) Proxy needs to use hard_timeout instead of soft_timeout when it is
     reading from one buffer and writing to another, at least until it has
     a custom timeout handler.  [Roy Fielding and Petr Lampa]

  *) Fixed problem on IRIX with servers hanging in IdentityCheck,
     apparently due to a mismatch between sigaction and setjmp.
     [Roy Fielding] PR#502

  *) Log correct status code if we timeout before receiving a request (408)
     or if we received a request-line that was too long to process (414).
     [Ed Korthof and Roy Fielding] PR#601

  *) Virtual hosts with the same ServerName, but on different ports, were
     not being selected properly.  [Ed Korthof]

  *) Added code to return the requested IP address from proxy_host2addr()
     if gethostbyaddr() fails due to reverse DNS lookup problems. Original
     change submitted by Jozsef Hollosi <hollosi@sbcm.com>.
     [Chuck Murcko] PR#614

  *) If multiple requests on a single connection are used to retrieve
     data from different virtual hosts, the virtual host list would be
     scanned starting with the most recently used VH instead of the first,
     causing most virtual hosts to be ignored.
     [Paul Sutton and Martin Mares] PR#610

  *) The OS/2 handling of process group was broken by a porting patch for
     MPE, so restored prior code for OS/2.  [Roy Fielding and Garey Smiley]

  *) Inherit virtual server port from main server if none (or "*") is
     given for VirtualHost.  [Dean Gaudet] PR#576

  *) If the lookup for a DirectoryIndex name with content negotiation
     has found matching variants, but none are acceptable, return the
     negotiation result if there are no more DirectoryIndex names to lookup.
     [Petr Lampa and Roy Fielding]

  *) If a soft_timeout occurs after keepalive is set, then the main child
     loop would try to read another request even though the connection
     has been aborted.  [Roy Fielding]

  *) Configure changes: Allow for whitespace at the start of a
     Module declaration. Also, be more understanding about the
     CC=/OPTIM= format in Configuration. Finally, fix compiler
     flags if using HP-UX's cc compiler. [Jim Jagielski]

  *) Subrequests and internal redirects now inherit the_request from the
     original request-line. [Roy Fielding]

  *) Test for error conditions before creating output header fields, since
     we don't want the error message to include those fields.  Likewise,
     reset the content_language(s) and content_encoding of the response
     before generating or redirecting to an error message, since the new
     message will have its own Content-* definitions. [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Restored the semantics of headers_out (headers sent only with 200..299
     and 304 responses) and err_headers_out (headers sent with all responses).
     Avoid the overhead of copying tables if err_headers_out is empty
     (the usual case).  [Roy Fielding]

  *) Fixed a couple places where a check for the default Content-Type was
     not properly checking both the value configured by the DefaultType
     directive and the DEFAULT_TYPE symbol in httpd.h.  Changed the value
     of DEFAULT_TYPE to match the documented default (text/plain).
     [Dean Gaudet] PR#506

  *) Escape the HTML-sensitive characters in the Request-URI that is
     output for each child by mod_status. [Dean Gaudet and Ken Coar] PR#501

  *) Properly initialize the flock structures used by the mutex locking
     around accept() when USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT is defined.
     [Marc Slemko]

  *) The method for determining PATH_INFO has been restored to the pre-1.2b
     (and NCSA httpd) definition wherein it was the extra path info beyond
     the CGI script filename.  The environment variable FILEPATH_INFO has
     been removed, and instead we supply the original REQUEST_URI to any
     script that wants to be Apache-specific and needs the real URI path.
     This solves a problem with existing scripts that use extra path info
     in the ScriptAlias directive to pass options to the CGI script.
     [Roy Fielding]

  *) The _default_ change in 1.2b10 will change the behaviour on configs
     that use multiple Listen statements for listening on multiple ports.
     But that change is necessary to make _default_ consistent with other
     forms of <VirtualHost>.  It requires such configs to be modified
     to use <VirtualHost _default_:*>.  The documentation has been
     updated.  [Dean Gaudet] PR#530

  *) If an ErrorDocument CGI script is used to respond to an error
     generated by another CGI script which has already read the message
     body of the request, the server would block trying to read the
     message body again.  [Rob Hartill]

  *) signal() replacement conflicted with a define on QNX (and potentially
     other platforms). Fixed. [Ben Laurie] PR#512

Changes with Apache 1.2b10

  *) Allow HTTPD_ROOT, SERVER_CONFIG_FILE, DEFAULT_PATH, and SHELL_PATH
     to be configured via -D in Configuration.  [Dean Gaudet] PR#449

  *) <VirtualHost _default_:portnum> didn't work properly.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Added prototype for mktemp() for SUNOS4 [Marc Slemko]

  *) In mod_proxy.c, check return values for proxy_host2addr() when reading
     config, in case the hostent struct returned is trash.
     [Chuck Murcko] PR #491

  *) Fixed the fix in 1.2b9 for parsing URL query info into args for CGI
     scripts.  [Dean Gaudet, Roy Fielding, Marc Slemko]

Changes with Apache 1.2b9  [never announced]

  *) Reset the MODULE_MAGIC_NUMBER to account for the unsigned port
     changes and in anticipation of 1.2 final release.  [Roy Fielding]

  *) Fix problem with scripts not receiving a SIGPIPE when client drops
     the connection (e.g., when user presses Stop).  Apache will now stop
     trying to send a message body immediately after an error from write.
     [Roy Fielding and Nathan Kurz] PR#335

  *) Rearrange Configuration.tmpl so that mod_rewrite has higher priority
     than mod_alias, and mod_alias has higher priority than mod_proxy;
     rearranged other modules to enhance understanding of their purpose
     and relative order (and maybe even reduce some overhead).
     [Roy Fielding and Sameer Parekh]

  *) Fix graceful restart.  Eliminate many signal-related race
     conditions in both forms of restart, and in SIGTERM.  See
     htdocs/manual/stopping.html for details on stopping and
     restarting the parent.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Fix memory leaks in mod_rewrite, mod_browser, mod_include.  Tune
     memory allocator to avoid a behaviour that required extra blocks to
     be allocated.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Allow suexec to access files relative to current directory but not
     above.  (Excluding leading / or any .. directory.)  [Ken Coar]
     PR#269, 319, 395

  *) Fix suexec segfault when group doesn't exist. [Gregory Neil Shapiro]
     PR#367, 368, 354, 453

  *) Fix the above fix: if suexec is enabled, avoid destroying r->url
     while obtaining the /~user and save the username in a separate data
     area so that it won't be overwritten by the call to getgrgid(), and
     fix some misuse of the pool string allocation functions.  Also fixes
     a general problem with parsing URL query info into args for CGI scripts.
     [Roy Fielding] PR#339, 367, 354, 453

  *) Fix IRIX warning about bzero undefined. [Marc Slemko]

  *) Fix problem with <Directory proxy:...>. [Martin Kraemer] PR#271

  *) Corrected spelling of "authoritative".  AuthDBAuthoratative became
     AuthDBAuthoritative. [Marc Slemko] PR#420

  *) MaxClients should be at least 1. [Lars Eilebrecht] PR#375

  *) The default handler now logs invalid methods or URIs (i.e. PUT on an
     object that can't be PUT, or FOOBAR for some method FOOBAR that
     apache doesn't know about at all).  Log 404s that occur in mod_include.
     [Paul Sutton, John Van Essen]

  *) If a soft timeout (or lingerout) occurs while trying to flush a
     buffer or write inside buff.c or fread'ing from a CGI's output,
     then the timeout would be ignored. [Roy Fielding] PR#373

  *) Work around a bug in Netscape Navigator versions 2.x, 3.x and 4.0b2's
     parsing of headers.  If the terminating empty-line CRLF occurs starting
     at the 256th or 257th byte of output, then Navigator will think a normal
     image is invalid.  We are guessing that this is because their initial
     read of a new request uses a 256 byte buffer. We check the bytes written
     so far and, if we are about to tickle the bug, we instead insert a
     padding header of eminent bogosity. [Roy Fielding and Dean Gaudet] PR#232

  *) Fixed SIGSEGV problem when a DirectoryIndex file is also the source
     of an external redirection.  [Roy Fielding and Paul Sutton]

  *) Configure would create a broken Makefile if the configuration file
     contained a commented-out Rule.  [Roy Fielding]

  *) Promote per_dir_config and subprocess_env from the subrequest to the
     main request in mod_negotiation.  In particular this fixes a bug
     where <Files> sections wouldn't properly apply to negotiated content.
     [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Fix a potential deadlock in mod_cgi script_err handling.
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) rotatelogs zero-pads the logfile names to improve alphabetic sorting.
     [Mitchell Blank Jr]

  *) Updated mod_rewrite to 3.0.4: Fixes HTTP redirects from within
     .htaccess files because the RewriteBase was not replaced correctly.
     Updated mod_rewrite to 3.0.5: Fixes problem with rewriting inside
     <Directory> sections missing a trailing /.  [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Clean up Linux settings in conf.h by detecting 2.x versus 1.x.  For
     1.x the settings are those of pre-1.2b8.  For 2.x we include
     USE_SHMGET_SCOREBOARD (scoreboard in shared memory rather than file) and
     HAVE_SYS_RESOURCE_H (enable the RLimit commands).
     [Dean Gaudet] PR#336, PR#340

  *) Redirect did not preserve ?query_strings when present in the client's
     request.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Configure was finding non-modules on EXTRA_LIBS. [Frank Cringle] PR#380

  *) Use /bin/sh5 on ULTRIX.  [P. Alejandro Lopez-Valencia] PR#369

  *) Add UnixWare compile/install instructions.  [Chuck Murcko]

  *) Add mod_example (illustration of API techniques).  [Ken Coar]

  *) Add macro for memmove to conf.h for SUNOS4. [Marc Slemko]

  *) Improve handling of directories when filenames have spaces in them.
     [Chuck Murcko]

  *) For hosts with multiple IP addresses, try all additional addresses if
     necessary to get a connect. Fail only if hostent address list is
     exhausted. [Chuck Murcko]

  *) More signed/unsigned port fixes.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) HARD_SERVER_LIMIT can be defined in the Configuration file now.
     [Dean Gaudet]

Changes with Apache 1.2b8

  *) suexec.c doesn't close the log file, allowing CGIs to continue writing
     to it.  [Marc Slemko]

  *) The addition of <Location> and <File> directives made the
     sub_req_lookup_simple() function bogus, so we now handle
     the special cases directly.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) We now try to log where the server is dumping core when a fatal
     signal is received.  [Ken Coar]

  *) Improved lingering_close by adding a special timeout, removing the
     spurious log messages, removing the nonblocking settings (they
     are not needed with the better timeout), and adding commentary
     about the NO_LINGCLOSE and USE_SO_LINGER issues.  NO_LINGCLOSE is
     now the default for SunOS4, UnixWare, NeXT, and IRIX.  [Roy Fielding]

  *) Send error messages about setsockopt failures to the server error
     log instead of stderr.  [Roy Fielding]

  *) Fix loopholes in proxy cache expiry vis a vis alarms. [Brian Moore]

  *) Stopgap solution for CGI 3-second delay with server-side includes: if
     processing a subrequest, allocate memory from r->main->pool instead
     of r->pool so that we can avoid waiting for free_proc_chain to cleanup
     in the middle of an SSI request.  [Dean Gaudet] PR #122

  *) Fixed status of response when POST is received for a nonexistent URL
     (was sending 405, now 404) and when any method is sent with a
     full-URI that doesn't match the server and the server is not acting
     as a proxy (was sending 501, now 403).  [Roy Fielding]

  *) Host port changed to unsigned short. [Ken Coar] PR #276

  *) Fix typo in command definition of AuthAuthoritative. [Ken Coar] PR #246

  *) Defined USE_SHMGET_SCOREBOARD for shared memory on Linux.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Report extra info from errno with many errors that cause httpd to exit.
     spawn_child, popenf, and pclosef now have valid errno returns in the
     event of an error.  Correct problems where errno was stomped on
     before being reported.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) In the proxy, if the cache filesystem was full, garbage_coll() was
     never called, and thus the filesystem would remain full indefinitely.
     We now also remove incomplete cache files left if the origin server
     didn't send a Content-Length header and either the client has aborted
     transfer or bwrite() to client has failed. [Petr Lampa]

  *) Fixed the handling of module and script-added header fields.
     Improved the interface for sending header fields and reduced
     the duplication of code between sending okay responses and errors.
     We now always send both headers_out and err_headers_out, and
     ensure that the server-reserved fields are not being overridden,
     while not overriding those that are not reserved.  [Roy Fielding]

  *) Moved transparent content negotiation fields to err_headers_out
     to reflect above changes.  [Petr Lampa]

  *) Fixed the determination of whether or not we should make the
     connection persistent for all of the cases where some other part
     of the server has already indicated that we should not.  Also
     improved the ordering of the test so that chunked encoding will
     be set whenever it is desired instead of only when KeepAlive
     is enabled. Added persistent connection capability for most error
     responses (those that do not indicate a bad input stream) when
     accessed by an HTTP/1.1 client. [Roy Fielding]

  *) Added missing timeouts for sending header fields, error responses,
     and the last chunk of chunked encoding, each of which could have
     resulted in a process being stuck in write forever.  Using soft_timeout
     requires that the sender check for an aborted connection rather than
     continuing after an EINTR.  Timeouts that used to be initiated before
     send_http_header (and never killed) are now initiated only within or
     around the routines that actually do the sending, and not allowed to
     propagate above the caller.  [Roy Fielding]

  *) mod_auth_anon required an @ or a . in the email address, not both.
     [Dirk vanGulik]

  *) per_dir_defaults weren't set correctly until directory_walk for
     name-based vhosts.  This fixes an obscure bug with the wrong config
     info being used for vhosts that share the same ip as the server.
     [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Improved generation of modules/Makefile to be more generic for
     new module directories. [Ken Coar, Chuck Murcko, Roy Fielding]

  *) Generate makefile dependency for Configuration based on the actual
     name given when running the Configure process.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Fixed problem with vhost error log not being set prior to
     initializing virtual hosts. [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Fixed infinite loop when a trailing slash is included after a type map
     file URL (extra path info). [Petr Lampa]

  *) Fixed server status updating of per-connection counters. [Roy Fielding]

  *) Add documentation for DNS issues (reliability and security), and try
     to explain the virtual host matching process.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Try to continue gracefully by disabling the vhost if a DNS lookup
     fails while parsing the configuration file.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Improved calls to setsockopt.  [Roy Fielding]

  *) Negotiation changes: Don't output empty content-type in variant list;
     Output charset in variant list; Return sooner from handle_multi() if
     no variants found; Add handling of '*' wildcard in Accept-Charset.
     [Petr Lampa and Paul Sutton]

  *) Fixed overlaying of request/sub-request notes and headers in
     mod_negotiation.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) If two variants' charset quality are equal and one is the default
     charset (iso-8859-1), then prefer the variant that was specifically
     listed in Accept-Charset instead of the default.  [Petr Lampa]

  *) Memory allocation problem in push_array() -- it would corrupt memory
     when nalloc==0.  [Kai Risku <krisku@tf.hut.fi> and Roy Fielding]

  *) invoke_handler() doesn't handle mime arguments in content-type
     [Petr Lampa] PR#160

  *) Reduced IdentityCheck timeout to 30 seconds, as per RFC 1413 minimum.
     [Ken Coar]

  *) Fixed problem with ErrorDocument not working for virtual hosts
     due to one of the performance changes in 1.2b7. [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Log an error message if we get a request header that is too long,
     since it may indicate a buffer overflow attack. [Marc Slemko]

  *) Made is_url() allow "[-.+a-zA-Z0-9]+:" as a valid scheme and
     not reject URLs without a double-slash, as per RFC2068 section 3.2.
     [Ken Coar] PR #146, #187

  *) Added table entry placeholder for new header_parser callback
     in all of the distributed modules. [Ken Coar] PR #191

  *) Allow for cgi files without the .EXE extension on them under OS/2.
     [Garey Smiley] PR #59

  *) Fixed error message when resource is not found and URL contains
     path info. [Petr Lampa and Dean Gaudet] PR #40

  *) Fixed user and server confusion over what should be a virtual host
     and what is the main server, resulting in access to something
     other than the name defined in the virtualhost directive (but
     with the same IP address) failing. [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Updated mod_rewrite to version 3.0.2, which: fixes compile error on
     AIX; improves the redirection stuff to enable the users to generally
     redirect to http, https, gopher and ftp; added TIME variable for
     RewriteCond which expands to YYYYMMDDHHMMSS strings and added the
     special patterns >STRING, <STRING and =STRING to RewriteCond, which
     can be used in conjunction with %{TIME} or other variables to create
     time-dependent rewriting rules. [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) bpushfd() no longer notes cleanups for the file descriptors it is handed.
     Module authors may need to adjust their code for proper cleanup to take
     place (that is, call note_cleanups_for_fd()). This change fixes problems
     with file descriptors being erroneously closed when the proxy module was
     in use. [Ben Laurie]

  *) Fix bug in suexec reintroduced by changes in 1.2b7 which allows
     initgroups() to hose the group information needed for later
     comparisons. [Randy Terbush]

  *) Remove unnecessary call to va_end() in create_argv() which
     caused a SEGV on some systems.

  *) Use proper MAXHOSTNAMELEN symbol for limiting length of server name.
     [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Clear memory allocated for listeners. [Randy Terbush]

  *) Improved handling of IP address as a virtualhost address and
     introduced "_default_" as a synonym for the default vhost config.
     [Dean Gaudet] PR #212

Changes with Apache 1.2b7

  *) Port to  UXP/DS(V20) [Toshiaki Nomura <nom@yk.fujitsu.co.jp>]

  *) unset Content-Length if chunked (RFC-2068) [Petr Lampa]

  *) mod_negotiation fixes [Petr Lampa] PR#157, PR#158, PR#159
     - replace protocol response numbers with symbols
     - save variant-list into main request notes
     - free allocated memory from subrequests
     - merge notes, headers_out and err_headers_out

  *) changed status check mask in proxy_http.c from "HTTP/#.# ### *" to
     "HTTP/#.# ###*" to be more lenient about what we accept.
     [Chuck Murcko]

  *) more proxy FTP bug fixes:
     - Changed send_dir() to remove user/passwd from displayed URL.
     - Changed login error messages to be more descriptive.
     - remove setting of SO_DEBUG socket option
     - Make ftp_getrc() more lenient about multiline responses,
       specifically, 230 responses which don't have continuation 230-
       on each line). These seem to be all NT FTP servers, and while
       perhaps questionable, they appear to be legal by RFC 959.
     - Add missing kill_timeout() after transfer to user completes.
     [Chuck Murcko]

  *) Fixed problem where a busy server could hang when restarting
     after being sent a SIGHUP due to child processes not exiting.
     [Marc Slemko]

  *) Modify mod_include escaping so a '\' only signifies an escaped
     character if the next character is one that needs
     escaping.  [Ben Laurie]

  *) Eliminated possible infinite loop in mod_imap when relative URLs are
     used with a 'base' directive that does not have a '/' in it.
     [Marc Slemko, reported by Onno Witvliet <onno@tc.hsa.nl>]

  *) Reduced the default timeout from 1200 seconds to 300, and the
     one in the sample configfile from 400 to 300.  [Marc Slemko]

  *) Stop vbprintf from crashing if given a NULL string pointer;
     print (null) instead.  [Ken Coar]

  *) Don't disable Nagle algorithm if system doesn't have TCP_NODELAY.
     [Marc Slemko and Roy Fielding]

  *) Fixed problem with mod_cgi-generated internal redirects trying to
     read the request message-body twice. [Archie Cobbs and Roy Fielding]

  *) Reduced timeout on lingering close, removed possibility of a blocked
     read causing the child to hang, and stopped logging of errors if
     the socket is not connected (reset by client).  [Roy Fielding]

  *) Rearranged main child loop to remove duplication of code in
     select/accept and keep-alive requests, fixed several bugs regarding
     checking scoreboard_image for exit indication and failure to
     account for all success conditions and trap all error conditions,
     prevented multiple flushes before closing the socket; close the entire
     socket buffer instead of just one descriptor, prevent logging of
     EPROTO and ECONNABORTED on platforms where supported, and generally
     improved readability.  [Roy Fielding]

  *) Extensive performance improvements. Cleaned up inefficient use of
     auto initializers, multiple is_matchexp calls on a static string,
     and excessive merging of response_code_strings. [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Added double-buffering to mod_include to improve performance on
     server-side includes. [Marc Slemko]

  *) Several fixes for suexec wrapper. [Randy Terbush]
     - Make wrapper work for files on NFS filesystem.
     - Fix portability problem of MAXPATHLEN.
     - Fix array overrun problem in clean_env().
     - Fix allocation of PATH environment variable

  *) Removed extraneous blank line is description of mod_status chars.
     [Kurt Kohler]

  *) Logging of errors from the call_exec routine simply went nowhere,
     since the logfile fd has been closed, so now we send them to stderr.
     [Harald T. Alvestrand]

  *) Fixed core dump when DocumentRoot is a CGI.
     [Ben Laurie, reported by geddis@tesserae.com]

  *) Fixed potential file descriptor leak in mod_asis; updated it and
     http_core to use pfopen/pfclose instead of fopen/fclose.
     [Randy Terbush and Roy Fielding]

  *) Fixed handling of unsigned ints in ap_snprintf() on some chips such
     as the DEC Alpha which is 64-bit but uses 32-bit ints.
     [Dean Gaudet and Ken Coar]

  *) Return a 302 response code to the client when sending a redirect
     due to a missing trailing '/' on a directory instead of a 301; now
     it is cacheable. [Markus Gyger]

  *) Fix condition where, if a bad directive occurs in .htaccess, and
     sub_request() goes first to this directory, then log_reason() will
     SIGSEGV because it doesn't have initialized r->per_dir_config.
     [PR#162 from Petr Lampa, fix by Marc Slemko and Dean Gaudet]

  *) Fix handling of lang_index in is_variant_better().  This was
     causing problems which resulted in the server sending the
     wrong language document in some cases. [Petr Lampa]

  *) Remove free() from clean_env() in suexec wrapper. This was nuking
     the clean environment on some systems.

  *) Tweak byteserving code (e.g. serving PDF files) to work around
     bugs in Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer.
     Emit Content-Length header when sending multipart/byteranges.
     [Alexei Kosut]

  *) Port to HI-UX/WE2. [Nick Maclaren]

  *) Port to HP MPE operating system for HP 3000 machines
     [Mark Bixby <markb@cccd.edu>]

  *) Fixed bug which caused a segmentation fault if only one argument
     given to RLimit* directives. [Ed Korthof]

  *) Continue persistent connection after 204 or 304 response. [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Improved buffered output to the client by delaying the flush decision
     until the BUFF code is actually about to read the next request.
     This fixes a problem introduced in 1.2b5 with clients that send
     an extra CRLF after a POST request. Also improved chunked output
     performance by combining writes using writev() and removing as
     many bflush() calls as possible.  NOTE: Platforms without writev()
     must add -DNO_WRITEV to the compiler CFLAGS, either in Configuration
     or Configure, unless we have already done so.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Fixed mod_rewrite bug which truncated the rewritten URL [Marc Slemko]

  *) Fixed mod_info output corruption bug introduced by buffer overflow
     fixes. [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Fixed http_protocol to correctly output all HTTP/1.1 headers, including
     for the special case of a 304 response.  [Paul Sutton]

  *) Improved handling of TRACE method by bypassing normal method handling
     and header parsing routines; fixed Allow response to always allow TRACE.
     [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Fixed compiler warnings in the regex library. [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Cleaned-up some of the generated HTML. [Ken Coar]

Changes with Apache 1.2b6

  *) Allow whitespace in imagemap mapfile coordinates. [Marc Slemko]

  *) Fix typo introduced in fix for potential infinite loop around
     accept() in child_main(). This change caused the rev to 1.2b6.
     1.2b5 was never a public beta.

Changes with Apache 1.2b5

  *) Change KeepAlive semantics (On|Off instead of a number), add
     MaxKeepAliveRequests directive. [Alexei Kosut]

  *) Various NeXT compilation patches, as well as a change in
     regex/regcomp.c since that file also used a NEXT define.
     [Andreas Koenig]

  *) Allow * to terminate the end of a directory match in mod_dir.
     Allows /~* to match for both /~joe and /~joe/. [David Bronder]

  *) Don't call can_exec() if suexec_enabled. Calling this requires
     scripts executed by the suexec wrapper to be world executable, which
     defeats one of the advantages of running the wrapper. [Randy Terbush]

  *) Portability Fix: IRIX complained with 'make clean' about *pure* (removed)
     [Jim Jagielski]

  *) Migration from sprintf() to snprintf() to avoid buffer
     overflows. [Marc Slemko]

  *) Provide portable snprintf() implementation (ap_snprintf)
     as well as *cvt family. [Jim Jagielski]

  *) Portability Fix: NeXT lacks unistd.h so we wrap it's inclusion
     [Jim Jagielski]

  *) Remove mod_fastcgi.c from the distribution. This module appears
     to be maintained more through the Open Market channels and should
     continue to be easily available at http://www.fastcgi.com/

  *) Fixed bug in modules/Makefile that wouldn't allow building in more
     than one subdirectory (or cleaning, either). [Jeremy Laidman]

  *) mod_info assumed that the config files were relative to ServerRoot.
     [Ken the Rodent]

  *) CGI scripts called as an error document resulting from failed
     CGI execution would hang waiting for POST'ed data. [Rob Hartill]

  *) Log reason when mod_dir returns access HTTP_FORBIDDEN
     [Ken the Rodent]

  *) Properly check errno to prevent display of a directory index
     when server receives a long enough URL to confuse stat().
     [Marc Slemko]

  *) Several security enhancements to suexec wrapper. It is _highly_
     recommended that previously installed versions of the wrapper
     be replaced with this version.  [Randy Terbush, Jason Dour]

        - ~user execution now properly restricted to ~user's home
          directory and below.
        - execution restricted to UID/GID > 100
        - restrict passed environment to known variables
        - call setgid() before initgroups() (portability fix)
        - remove use of setenv() (portability fix)

  *) Add HTTP/1.0 response forcing. [Ben Laurie]

  *) Add access control via environment variables. [Ben Laurie]

  *) Add rflush() function. [Alexei Kosut]

  *) remove duplicate pcalloc() call in new_connection().

  *) Fix incorrect comparison which could allow number of children =
     MaxClients + 1 if less than HARD_SERVER_LIMIT. Also fix potential
     problem if StartServers > HARD_SERVER_LIMIT. [Ed Korthof]

  *) Updated support for OSes (MachTen, ULTRIX, Paragon, ISC, OpenBSD
     AIX PS/2, CONVEXOS. [Jim Jagielski]

  *) Replace instances of inet_ntoa() with inet_addr() for ProxyBlock.
     It's more portable. [Martin Kraemer]

  *) Replace references to make in Makefile.tmpl with $(MAKE).
     [Chuck Murcko]

  *) Add ProxyBlock directive w/IP address caching. Add IP address
     caching to NoCache directive as well. ProxyBlock works with all
     handlers; NoCache now also works with FTP for anonymous logins.
     Still more code cleanup. [Chuck Murcko]

  *) Add "header parse" API hook [Ben Laurie]

  *) Fix byte ordering problems for REMOTE_PORT [Chuck Murcko]

  *) suEXEC wrapper was freeing memory that had not been malloc'ed.

  *) Correctly allow access and auth directives in <Files> sections in
     server config files. [Alexei Kosut]

  *) Fix bug with ServerPath that could cause certain files to be not
     found by the server. [Alexei Kosut]

  *) Fix handling of ErrorDocument so that it doesn't remove a trailing
     double-quote from text and so that it properly checks for unsupported
     status codes using the new index_of_response interface. [Roy Fielding]

  *) Multiple fixes to the lingering_close code in order to avoid being
     interrupted by a stray timeout, to avoid lingering on a connection
     that has already been aborted or never really existed, to ensure that
     we stop lingering as soon as any error condition is received, and to
     prevent being stuck indefinitely if the read blocks.  Also improves
     reporting of error conditions.  [Marc Slemko and Roy Fielding]

  *) Fixed initialization of parameter structure for sigaction.
     [mgyger@itr.ch, Adrian Filipi-Martin]

  *) Fixed reinitializing the parameters before each call to accept and
     select, and removed potential for infinite loop in accept.
     [Roy Fielding, after useful PR from adrian@virginia.edu]

  *) Fixed condition where, if a child fails to fork, the scoreboard would
     continue to say SERVER_STARTING forever. Eventually, the main process
     would refuse to start new children because count_idle_servers() will
     count those SERVER_STARTING entries and will always report that there
     are enough idle servers. [Phillip Vandry]

  *) Fixed bug in bcwrite regarding failure to account for partial writes.
     Avoided calling bflush() when the client is pipelining requests.
     Removed unnecessary flushes from http_protocol. [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Added description of "." mode in server-status [Jim Jagielski]

Changes with Apache 1.2b4

  *) Fix possible race condition in accept_mutex_init() that
     could leave a small security hole open allowing files to be
     overwritten in cases where the server UID has write permissions.
     [Marc Slemko]

  *) Fix awk compatibilty problem in Configure. [Jim Jagielski]

  *) Fix portablity problem in util_script where ARG_MAX may not be
     defined for some systems.

  *) Add changes to allow compilation on Machten 4.0.3 for PowerPC.
     [Randal Schwartz]

  *) OS/2 changes to support an MMAP style scoreboard file and UNIX
     style magic #! token for better script portability. [Garey Smiley]

  *) Fix bug in suexec wrapper introduced in b3 that would cause failed
     execution for ~userdir CGI. [Jason Dour]

  *) Fix initgroups() business in suexec wrapper. [Jason Dour]

  *) Fix month off by one in suexec wrapper logging.

Changes with Apache 1.2b3:

  *) Fix error in mod_cgi which could cause resources not to be properly
     freed, or worse. [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Fix find_string() NULL pointer dereference. [Howard Fear]

  *) Add set_flag_slot() at the request of Dirk and others.
     [Dirk vanGulik]

  *) Sync mod_rewrite with patch level 10. [Ralf Engelschall]

  *) Add changes to improve the error message given for invalid
     ServerName parameters. [Dirk vanGulik]

  *) Add "Authoritative" directive for Auth modules that don't
     currently have it. This gives admin control to assign authoritative
     control to an authentication scheme and allow "fall through" for
     those authentication modules that aren't "Authoritative" thereby
     allowing multiple authentication mechanisms to be chained.
     [Dirk vanGulik]

  *) Remove requirement for ResourceConfig/AccessConfig if not using
     the three config file layout. [Randy Terbush]

  *) Add PASV mode to mod_proxy FTP handler. [Chuck Murcko]

  *) Changes to suexec wrapper to fix the following problems:
     1.  symlinked homedirs will kill ~userdirs.
     2.  initgroups() on Linux 2.0.x clobbers gr->grid.
     3.  CGI command lines paramters problems
     4.  pw-pwdir for "docroot check" still the httpd user's pw record.
    [Randy Terbush, Jason Dour]

  *) Change create_argv() to accept variable arguments. This fixes
     a problem where arguments were not getting passed to the CGI via
     argv[] when the suexec wrapper was active. [Randy Terbush, Jake Buchholz]

  *) Collapse multiple slashes in path URLs to properly apply
     handlers defined by <Location>. [Alexei Kosut]

  *) Define a sane set of DEFAULT_USER and DEFAULT_GROUP values for AIX.

  *) Improve the accuracy of request duration timings by setting
     r->request_time in read_request_line() instead of read_request().
     [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Reset timeout while reading via get_client_block() in mod_cgi.c
     Fixes problem with timed out transfers of large files. [Rasmus Lerdorf]

  *) Add the ability to pass different Makefile.tmpl files to Configure
     using the -make flag. [Rob Hartill]

  *) Fix coredump triggered when sending a SIGHUP to the server caused
     by an assertion failure, in turn caused by an uninitialised field in a
     listen_rec.
     [Ben Laurie]

  *) Add FILEPATH_INFO variable to CGI environment, which is equal to
     PATH_INFO from previous versions of Apache (in certain situations,
     Apache 1.2's PATH_INFO will be different than 1.1's). [Alexei Kosut]
     [later removed in 1.2b11]

  *) Add rwrite() function to API to allow for sending strings of
     arbitrary length. [Doug MacEachern]

  *) Remove rlim_t typedef for NetBSD. Do older versions need this?

  *) Defined rlim_t and WANTHSREGEX=yes and fixed waitpid() substitute for
     NeXT. [Jim Jagielski]

  *) Removed recent modification to promote the status code on internal
     redirects, since the correct fix was to change the default log format
     in mod_log_config so that it outputs the original status. [Rob Hartill]

Changes with Apache 1.2b2:

  *) Update set_signals() to use sigaction() for setting handlers.
     This appears to fix a re-entrant problem in the seg_fault()
     bus_error() handlers. [Randy Terbush]

  *) Changes to allow mod_status compile for OS/2 [Garey Smiley]

  *) changes for DEC AXP running OSF/1 v3.0. [Marc Evans]

  *) proxy_http.c bugfixes:  [Chuck Murcko]
        1) fixes possible NULL pointer reference w/NoCache
        2) fixes NoCache behavior when using ProxyRemote (ProxyRemote
           host would cache nothing if it was in the local domain,
           and the local domain was in the NoCache list)
        3) Adds Host: header when not available
        4) Some code cleanup and clarification

  *) mod_include.c bugfixes:
        1) Fixed an ommission that caused include variables to not
           be parsed in config errmsg directives [Howard Fear]
        2) Remove HAVE_POSIX_REGEX cruft [Alexei Kosut]
        3) Patch to fix compiler warnings [perrot@lal.in2p3.fr]
        4) Allow backslash-escaping to all quoted text
           [Ben Yoshino <ben@wiliki.eng.hawaii.edu>]
        5) Pass variable to command line if not set in XSSI's env
           [Howard Fear]

  *) Fix infinite loop when processing Content-language lines in
     type-map files. [Alexei Kosut]

  *) Closed file-globbing hole in test-cgi script. [Brian Behlendorf]

  *) Fixed problem in set_[user|group] that prevented CGI execution
     for non-virtualhosts when suEXEC was enabled. [Randy Terbush]

  *) Added PORTING information file.  [Jim Jagielski]

  *) Added definitions for S_IWGRP and S_IWOTH to conf.h [Ben Laurie]

  *) Changed default group to "nogroup" instead of "nobody" [Randy Terbush]

  *) Fixed define typo of FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT where
     USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT was intended.

  *) Fixed additional uses of 0xffffffff where INADDR_NONE was intended,
     which caused problems of systems where socket s_addr is >32bits.

  *) Added comment to explain (r->chunked = 1) side-effect in
     http_protocol.c [Roy Fielding]

  *) Replaced use of index() in mod_expires.c with more appropriate
     and portable isdigit() test.  [Ben Laurie]

  *) Updated Configure for ...
        OS/2          (DEF_WANTHSREGEX=yes, other code changes)
        *-dg-dgux*    (bad pattern match)
        QNX           (DEF_WANTHSREGEX=yes)
        *-sunos4*     (DEF_WANTHSREGEX=yes, -DUSEBCOPY)
        *-ultrix      (new)
        *-unixware211 (new)
     and added some user diagnostic info.  [Ben Laurie]

  *) In helpers/CutRule, replaced "cut" invocation with "awk" invocation
     for better portability. [Jim Jagielski]

  *) Updated helpers/GuessOS for ...
        SCO 5            (recognize minor releases)
        SCO UnixWare     (braindamaged uname, whatever-whatever-unixware2)
        SCO UnixWare 2.1.1      (requires a separate set of #defines in conf.h)
        IRIX64           (-sgi-irix64)
        ULTRIX           (-unknown-ultrix)
        SINIX            (-whatever-sysv4)
        NCR Unix         (-ncr-sysv4)
     and fixed something in helpers/PrintPath  [Ben Laurie]

Changes with Apache 1.2b1

  *) Not listed. See <http://www.apache.org/docs/new_features_1_2.html>

Changes with Apache 1.1.1

  *) Fixed bug where Cookie module would make two entries in the
     logfile for each access [Mark Cox]

  *) Fixed bug where Redirect in .htaccess files would cause memory
     leak. [Nathan Neulinger]

  *) Problems with mod_auth_msql fixed [Dirk vanGulik]

  *) Fix misspelling of "Anonymous_Authorative" directive in mod_auth_anon.

Changes with Apache 1.1.0

  *) Bring QNX support up to date. [Ben Laurie]

  *) Make virtual hosts default to main server keepalive parameters.
     [Alexei Kosut, Ben Laurie]

  *) Allow ScanHTMLTitles to work with lowercase <title> tags. [Alexei Kosut]

  *) Fix missing address family for connect, also remove unreachable statement
     in mod_proxy. [Ben Laurie]

  *) mod_env now turned on by default in Configuration.tmpl.

  *) Bugs which were fixed:
        a) yet more mod_proxy bugs [Ben Laurie]
        b) CGI works again with inetd [Alexei Kosut]
        c) Leading colons were stripped from passwords [osm@interguide.com]
        d) Another fix to multi-method Limit problem [jk@tools.de]

Changes with Apache 1.1b4

  *) r->bytes_sent variable restored. [Robert Thau]

  *) Previously broken multi-method <Limit> parsing fixed. [Robert Thau]

  *) More possibly unsecure programs removed from the support directory.

  *) More mod_auth_msql authentication improvements.

  *) VirtualHosts based on Host: headers no longer conflict with the
     Listen directive.

  *) OS/2 compatibility enhancements. [Gary Smiley]

  *) POST now allowed to directory index CGI scripts.

  *) Actions now work with files of the default type.

  *) Bugs which were fixed:
        a) more mod_proxy bugs
        b) early termination of inetd requests
        c) compile warnings on several systems
        d) problems when scripts stop reading output early

Changes with Apache 1.1b3

  *) Much of cgi-bin and all of cgi-src has been removed, due to
     various security holes found and that we could no longer support
     them.

  *) The "Set-Cookie" header is now special-cased to not merge multiple
     instances, since certain popular browsers can not handle multiple
     Set-Cookie instructions in a single header. [Paul Sutton]

  *) rprintf() added to buffer code, occurrences of sprintf removed.
     [Ben Laurie]

  *) CONNECT method for proxy module, which means tunneling SSL should work.
     (No crypto needed)  Also a NoCache config directive.

     functions now available to modules.

  *) mod_imap fixups, in particular Location: headers are now complete
     URL's.

  *) New "info" module which reports on installed module set through a
     special URL, a la mod_status.

  *) "ServerPath" directive added - allows for graceful transition
     for Host:-header-based virtual hosts.

  *) Anonymous authentication module improvements.

  *) MSQL authentication module improvements.

  *) Status module design improved - output now table-based. [Ben Laurie]

  *) htdigest utility included for use with digest authentication
     module.

  *) mod_negotiation: Accept values with wildcards to be treated with
     less priority than those without wildcards at the same quality
     value. [Alexei Kosut]

  *) Bugs which were fixed:
        a) numerous mod_proxy bugs
        b) CGI early-termination bug [Ben Laurie]
        c) Keepalives not working with virtual hosts
        d) RefererIgnore problems
        e) closing fd's twice in mod_include (causing core dumps on
           Linux and elsewhere).

Changes with Apache 1.1b2

  *) Bugfixes:
        a) core dumps in mod_digest
        b) truncated hostnames/ip address in the logs
        c) relative URL's in mod_imap map files

Changes with Apache 1.1b1

  *) Not listed. See <http://www.apache.org/docs/new_features_1_1.html>

Changes with Apache 1.0.3

  *) Internal redirects which occur in mod_dir.c now preserve the
     query portion of a request (the bit after the question mark).
     [Adam Sussman]

  *) Escape active characters '<', '>' and '&' in html output in
     directory listings, error messages and redirection links.
     [David Robinson]

  *) Apache will now work with LynxOS 2.3 and later [Steven Watt]

  *) Fix for POSIX compliance in waiting for processes in alloc.c.
     [Nick Williams]

  *) setsockopt no longer takes a const declared argument [Martijn Koster]

  *) Reset timeout timer after each successful fwrite() to the network.
     This patch adds a reset_timeout() procedure that is called by
     send_fd() to reset the timeout ever time data is written to the net.
     [Nathan Schrenk]

  *) timeout() signal handler now checks for SIGPIPE and reports
     lost connections in a more user friendly way. [Rob Hartill]

  *) Location of the "scoreboard" file which used to live in /tmp is
     now configurable (for OSes that can't use mmap) via ScoreBoardFile
     which works similar to PidFile (in httpd.conf) [Rob Hartill]

  *) Include sys/resource.h in the correct place for SunOS4 [Sameer Parekh]

  *) the pstrcat call in mod_cookies.c didn't have an ending NULL,
     which caused a SEGV with cookies enabled

  *) Output warning when MinSpareServers is set to <= 0 and change it to 1
     [Rob Hartill]

  *) Log the UNIX textual error returned by some system calls, in
     particular errors from accept() [David Robinson]

  *) Add strerror function to util.c for SunOS4 [Randy Terbush]

Changes with Apache 1.0.2

  *) patch to get Apache compiled on UnixWare 2.x, recommended as
     a temporary measure, pending rewrite of rfc931.c. [Chuck Murcko]

  *) Fix get_basic_auth_pw() to set the auth_type of the request.
     [David Robinson]

  *) past changes to http_config.c to only use the
     setrlimit function on systems defining RLIMIT_NOFILE
     broke the feature on SUNOS4. Now defines HAVE_RESOURCE
     for SUNOS and prototypes the needed functions.

  *) Remove uses of MAX_STRING_LEN/HUGE_STRING_LEN from several routines.
     [David Robinson]

  *) Fix use of pointer to scratch memory. [Cliff Skolnick]

  *) Merge multiple headers from CGI scripts instead of taking last

Changes with Apache 1.0.1

  *) Silence mod_log_referer and mod_log_agent if not configured
     [Randy Terbush]

  *) Recursive includes can occur if the client supplies PATH_INFO data
     and the server provider uses relative links; as file.html
     relative to /doc.shtml/pathinfo is /doc.shtml/file.html. [David Robinson]

  *) The replacement for initgroups() did not call {set,end}grent(). This
     had two implications: if anything else used getgrent(), then
     initgroups() would fail, and it was consuming a file descriptor.
     [Ben Laurie]

  *) On heavily loaded servers it was possible for the scoreboard to get
     out of sync with reality, as a result of a race condition.
     The observed symptoms are far more Apaches running than should
     be, and heavy system loads, generally followed by catastrophic
     system failure. [Ben Laurie]

  *) Fix typo in license. [David Robinson]

Changes with Apache 1.0.0                                        23 Nov 1995

  *) Not listed. See <http://www.apache.org/docs/new_features_1_0.html>

  *) New man page for 'httpd' added to support directory [David Robinson]

  *) .htgroup files can have more than one line giving members for a
     given group (each must have the group name in front), for NCSA
     back-compatibility [Robert Thau]

  *) Mutual exclusion around accept() is on by default for SVR4 systems
     generally, since they generally can't handle multiple processes in
     accept() on the same socket.  This should cure flaky behavior on
     a lot of those systems.  [David Robinson]

  *) AddType, AddEncoding, and AddLanguage directives take multiple
     extensions on a single command line [David Robinson]

  *) UserDir can be disabled for a given virtual host by saying
     "UserDir disabled" in the <VirtualHost> section --- it was a bug
     that this didn't work.  [David Robinson]

  *) Compiles on QNX [Ben Laurie]

  *) Corrected parsing of ctime time format [David Robinson]

  *) httpd does a perror() before exiting if it can't log its pid
     to the PidFile, to make diagnosing the error a bit easier.
     [David Robinson]

  *) <!--#include file="..."--> can no longer include files in the
     parent directory, for NCSA back-compatibility.  [David Robinson]

  *) '~' is *not* escaped in URIs generated for directory listings
     [Roy Fielding]

  *) Eliminated compiler warning in the imagemap module [Randy Terbush]

  *) Fixed bug involving handling URIs with escaped %-characters
     in redirects [David Robinson]

  *) Correctly handles internal redirects to files with names containing '%'
     [David Robinson]

  *) Repunctuated some error messages [Aram Mirzadeh, Andrew Wilson]

  *) Use geteuid() rather than getuid() to see if we have root privilege,
     so that server correctly resets privilege if run setuid root.  [Andrew
     Wilson]

  *) Handle ftp: and telnet: URLs correctly in imagemaps (built-in module)
     [Randy Terbush]

  *) Fix relative URLs in imagemap files [Randy Terbush]

  *) Somewhat better fix for the old "Alias /foo/ /bar/" business
     [David Robinson]

  *) Don't repeatedly open the ErrorLog if a bunch of <VirtualHost>
     entries all name the same one. [David Robinson]

  *) Fix directory listings with filenames containing unusual characters
     [David Robinson]

  *) Better URI-escaping for generated URIs in directories with filenames
     containing unusual characters [Ben Laurie]

  *) Fixed potential FILE* leak in http_main.c [Ben Laurie]

  *) Unblock alarms on error return from spawn_child() [David Robinson]

  *) Sample Config files have extra note for SCO users [Ben Laurie]

  *) Configuration has note for HP-UX users [Rob Hartill]

  *) Eliminated some bogus Linux-only #defines in conf.h [Aram Mirzadeh]

  *) Nuked bogus #define in httpd.h [David Robinson]

  *) Better test for whether a system has setrlimit() [David Robinson]

  *) Calls update_child_status() after reopen_scoreboard() [David Robinson]

  *) Doesn't send itself SIGHUP on startup when run in the -X debug-only mode
     [Ben Laurie]

Changes with Apache 0.8.14                                       19 Sep 1995

  *) Compiles on SCO ODT 3.0 [Ben Laurie]

  *) AddDescription works (better) [Ben Laurie]

  *) Leaves an intelligible error diagnostic when it can't set group
     privileges on standalone startup [Andrew Wilson]

  *) Compiles on NeXT again --- the 0.8.13 RLIMIT patch was failing on
     that machine, which claims to be BSD but does not support RLIMIT.
     [Randy Terbush]

  *) gcc -Wall no longer complains about an unused variable when util.c
     is compiled with -DMINIMAL_DNS [Andrew Wilson]

  *) Nuked another compiler warning for -Wall on Linux [Aram Mirzadeh]

Changes with Apache 0.8.13                                       07 Sep 1995

  *) Make IndexIgnore *work* (ooops) [Jarkko Torppa]

  *) Have built-in imagemap code recognize & honor Point directive [James
     Cloos]

  *) Properly default ServerName for virtual servers [Robert Thau]

  *) Rationalize handling of BSD in conf.h and elsewhere [Randy Terbush,
     Paul Richards and a cast of thousands...]

  *) On self-identified BSD systems (we don't try to guess any more),
     allocate a few extra file descriptors per virtual host with setrlimit,
     if we can, to avoid running out. [Randy Terbush]

  *) Write 22-character lock file name into buffer with enough space
     on startup [Konstantin Olchanski]

  *) Use archaic setpgrp() interface on NeXT, which requires it [Brian
     Pinkerton]

  *) Suppress -Wall warning by casting const away in util.c [Aram Mirzadeh]

  *) Suppress -Wall warning by initializing variable in negotiation code
     [Tobias Weingartner]

Changes with Apache 0.8.12                                       31 Aug 1995

  *) Doesn't pause three seconds after including a CGI script which is
     too slow to die off (this is done by not even trying to kill off
     subprocesses, including the SIGTERM/pause/SIGKILL routine, until
     after the entire document has been processed).  [Robert Thau]

  *) Doesn't do SSI if Options Includes is off.  (Ooops).  [David Robinson]

  *) Options IncludesNoExec allows inclusion of at least text/* [Roy Fielding]

  *) Allows .htaccess files to override <Directory> sections naming the
     same directory [David Robinson]

  *) Removed an efficiency hack in sub_req_lookup_uri which was
     causing certain extremely marginal cases (e.g., ScriptAlias of a
     *particular* index.html file) to fail.  [David Robinson]

  *) Doesn't log an error when the requested URI requires
     authentication, but no auth header line was supplied by the
     client; this is a normal condition (the client doesn't no auth is
     needed here yet).  [Robert Thau]

  *) Behaves more sanely when the name server loses its mind [Sean Welch]

  *) RFC931 code compiles cleanly on old BSDI releases [Randy Terbush]

  *) RFC931 code no longer passes out name of prior clients on current
     requests if the current request came from a server that doesn't
     do RFC931.  [David Robinson]

  *) Configuration script accepts "Module" lines with trailing whitespace.
     [Robert Thau]

  *) Cleaned up compiler warning from mod_access.c [Robert Thau]

  *) Cleaned up comments in mod_cgi.c [Robert Thau]

Changes with Apache 0.8.11                                       24 Aug 1995

  *) Wildcard <Directory> specifications work.  [Robert Thau]

  *) Doesn't loop for buggy CGI on Solaris [Cliff Skolnick]

  *) Symlink checks (FollowSymLinks off, or SymLinkIfOwnerMatch) always check
     the file being requested itself, in addition to the directories leading
     up to it. [Robert Thau]

  *) Logs access failures due to symlink checks or invalid client address
     in the error log [Roy Fielding, Robert Thau]

  *) Symlink checks deal correctly with systems where lstat of
     "/path/to/some/link/" follows the link.  [Thau, Fielding]

  *) Doesn't reset DirectoryIndex to 'index.html' when
     other directory options are set in a .htaccess file.  [Robert Thau]

  *) Clarified init code and nuked bogus warning in mod_access.c
     [Florent Guillaume]

  *) Corrected several directives in sample srm.conf
     --- includes corrections to directory indexing icon-related directives
     (using unknown.gif rather than unknown.xbm as the DefaultIcon, doing
     icons for encodings right, and turning on AddEncoding by default).
     [Roy Fielding]

  *) Corrected descriptions of args to AddIcon and AddAlt in command table
     [James Cloos]

  *) INSTALL & README mention "contributed modules" directory [Brian
     Behlendorf]

  *) Fixed English in the license language...  "for for" --> "for".
     [Roy Fielding]

  *) Fixed ScriptAlias/Alias interaction by moving ScriptAlias handling to
     mod_alias.c, merging it almost completely with handling of Alias, and
     adding a 'notes' field to the request_rec which allows the CGI module
     to discover whether the Alias module has put this request through
     ScriptAlias (which it needs to know for back-compatibility, as the old
     NCSA code did not check Options ExecCGI in ScriptAlias directories).
     [Robert Thau]

Changes with Apache 0.8.10                                       18 Aug 1995

  *) AllowOverride applies to the named directory, and not just
     subdirectories.  [David Robinson]

  *) Do locking for accept() exclusion (on systems that need it)
     using a special file created for the purpose in /usr/tmp, and
     not the error log; using the error log causes real problems
     if it's NFS-mounted; this is known to be the cause of a whole
     lot of "server hang" problems with Solaris.  [David Robinson;
     thanks to Merten Schumann for help diagnosing the problem].

Changes with Apache 0.8.9                                        12 Aug 1995

  *) Compiles with -DMAXIMUM_DNS ---- ooops! [Henrik Mortensen]

  *) Nested includes see environment variables of the including document,
     for NCSA bug-compatibility (some sites have standard footer includes
     which try to print out the last-modified date).  [Eric Hagberg/Robert
     Thau]

  *) <!--exec cgi="/some/uri/here"--> always treats the item named by the
     URI as a CGI script, even if it would have been treated as something
     else if requested directly, for NCSA back-compatibility.  (Note that
     this means that people who know the name of the script can see the
     code just by asking for it).  [Robert Thau]

  *) New version of dbmmanage script included in support directory as
     dbmmanage.new.

  *) Check if scoreboard file couldn't be opened, and say so, rather
     then going insane [David Robinson]

  *) POST to CGI works on A/UX [Jim Jagielski]

  *) AddIcon and AddAlt commands work properly [Rob Hartill]

  *) NCSA server push works properly --- the Arena bug compatibility
     workaround, which broke it, is gone (use -DARENA_BUG_WORKAROUND
     if you still want the workaround).  [Rob Hartill]

  *) If client didn't submit any Accept-encodings, ignore encodings in
     content negotiation.  (NB this will all have to be reworked anyway
     for the new HTTP draft).  [Florent Guillaume]

  *) Don't dump core when trying to log timed-out requests [Jim Jagielski]

  *) Really honor CacheNegotiatedDocs [Florent Guillaume]

  *) Give Redirect priority over Alias, for NCSA bug compatibility
     [David Robinson]

  *) Correctly set PATH_TRANSLATED in all cases from <!--#exec cmd=""-->,
     paralleling earlier bug fix for CGI [David Robinson]

  *) If DBM auth is improperly configured, report a server error and don't
     dump core.

  *) Deleted FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPTS from conf.h entry for A/UX;
     it seems to work well enough without it (even in a 10 hits/sec
     workout), and the overhead for the locking under A/UX is
     alarmingly high (though it is very low on other systems).
     [Eric Hagberg, Jim Jagielski]

  *) Fixed portability problems with mod_cookies.c [Cliff Skolnick]

  *) Further de-Berklize mod_cookies.c; change the bogus #include.  [Brian
     Behlendorf/Eric Hagberg]

  *) More improvements to default Configuration for A/UX [Jim Jagielski]

  *) Compiles clean on NEXT [Rob Hartill]

  *) Compiles clean on SGI [Robert Thau]

Changes with Apache 0.8.8                                        08 Aug 1995

  *) SunOS library prototypes now never included unless explicitly
     requested in the configuration (via -DSUNOS_LIB_PROTOTYPES);
     people using GNU libc on SunOS are screwed by prototypes for the
     standard library.

     (Those who wish to compile clean with gcc -Wall on a standard
     SunOS setup need the prototypes, and may obtain them using
     -DSUNOS_LIB_PROTOTYPES.  Those wishing to use -Wall on a system
     with nonstandard libraries are presumably competent to make their
     own arrangements).

  *) Strips trailing '/' characters off both args to the Alias command,
     to make 'Alias /foo/ /bar/' work.

Changes with Apache 0.8.7                                        03 Aug 1995

  *) Don't hang when restarting with a child from 'TransferLog "|..."' running
     [reported by David Robinson]

  *) Compiles clean on OSF/1 [David Robinson]

  *) Added some of the more recent significant changes (AddLanguage stuff,
     experimental LogFormat support) to CHANGES file in distribution root
     directory

Changes with Apache 0.8.6                                        02 Aug 1995

  *) Deleted Netscape reload workaround --- it's in violation of HTTP specs.
     (If you actually wanted a conditional GET which bypassed the cache, you
     couldn't get it). [Reported by Roy Fielding]

  *) Properly terminate headers on '304 Not Modified' replies to conditional
     GETs --- no browser we can find cares much, but the CERN proxy chokes.
     [Reported by Cliff Skolnick; fix discovered independently by Rob Hartill]

  *) httpd -v doesn't call itself "Shambhala".  [Reported by Chuck Murcko]

  *) SunOS lib-function prototypes in conf.h conditionalized on __GNUC__,
     not __SUNPRO_C (they're needed to quiet gcc -Wall, but acc chokes on 'em,
     and older versions don't set the __SUNPRO_C preprocessor variable).  On
     all other systems, these are never used anyway.  [Reported by Mark Cox].

  *) Scoreboard file (/tmp/htstatus.*) no longer publically writable.

Changes with Apache 0.8.5                                        01 Aug 1995

  *) Added last-minute configurable log experiment, as optional module

  *) Correctly set r->bytes_sent for HTTP/0.9 requests, so they get logged
     properly.  (One-line fix to http_protocol.c).

  *) Work around bogus behavior when reloading from Netscape.
     It's Netscape's bug --- for some reason they expect a request with
     If-modified-since: to not function as a conditional GET if it also
     comes with Pragma: no-cache, which is way out of line with the HTTP
     spec (according to Roy Fielding, the redactor).

  *) Added parameter to set maximum number of server processes.

  *) Added patches to make it work on A/UX.  A/UX is *weird*.  [Eric Hagberg,
     Jim Jagielski]

  *) IdentityCheck bugfix [Chuck Murcko].

  *) Corrected cgi-src/Makefile entry for new imagemap script.  [Alexei Kosut]

  *) More sample config file corrections; add extension to AddType for
     *.asis, move AddType generic description to its proper place, and
     fix miscellaneous typos. [ Alexei Kosut ]

  *) Deleted the *other* reference to the regents from the Berkeley
     legal disclaimer (everyplace).

  *) Nuked Shambhala name from src/README; had already cleaned it out
     of everywhere else.

Changes with Apache 0.8.4

  *) Changes to server-pool management parms --- renamed current
     StartServers to MinSpareServers, created separate StartServers
     parameter which means what it says, and renamed MaxServers to
     MaxSpareServers (though the old name still works, for NCSA 1.4
     back-compatibility).  The old names were generally regarded as
     too confusing.  Also altered "docs" in sample config files.

  *) More improvements to default config files ---
     sample directives (commented out) for XBitHack, BindAddress,
     CacheNegotiatedDocs, VirtualHost; decent set of AddLanguage
     defaults, AddTypes for send-as-is and imagemap magic types, and
     improvements to samples for DirectoryIndex [Alexei Kosut]

  *) Yet more improvements to default config files --- changes to
     Alexei's sample AddLanguage directives, and sample LanguagePriority
     [ Florent Guillaume ]

  *) Set config file locations properly if not set in httpd.conf
     [ David Robinson ]

  *) Don't escape URIs in internal redirects multiple times; don't
     do that when translating PATH_INFO to PATH_TRANSLATED either.
     [ David Robinson ]

  *) Corrected spelling of "Required" in 401 error reports [Andrew Wilson]

Changes with Apache 0.8.3

  *) Edited distribution README to *briefly* summarize installation
     procedures, and give a pointer to the INSTALL file in the src/
     directory.

  *) Upgraded imagemap script in cgi-bin to 1.8 version from more
     recent NCSA distributions.

  *) Bug fix to previous bug fix --- if .htaccess file and <Directory>
     exist for the same directory, use both and don't segfault.  [Reported
     by David Robinson]

  *) Proper makefile dependencies [David Robinson]

  *) Note (re)starts in error log --- reported by Rob Hartill.

  *) Only call no2slash() after get_path_info() has been done, to
     preserve multiple slashes in the PATH_INFO [NCSA compatibility,
     reported by Andrew Wilson, though this one is probably a real bug]

  *) Fixed mod_imap.c --- relative paths with base_uri referer don't
     dump core when Referer is not supplied. [Randy Terbush]

  *) Lightly edited sample config files to refer people to our documentation
     instead of NCSA's, and to list Rob McCool as *original* author (also
     deleted his old, and no doubt non-functional email address).  Would be
     nice to have examples of new features...

Changes with Apache 0.8.2                                        19 Jul 1995

  *) Added AddLanuage code [Florent Guillaume]

  *) Don't say "access forbidden" when a CGI script is not found.  [Mark Cox]

  *) All sorts of problems when MultiViews finds a directory.  It would
     be nice if mod_dir.c was robust enough to handle that, but for now,
     just punt.  [reported by Brian Behlendorf]

  *) Wait for all children on restart, to make sure that the old socket
     is gone and we can reopen it.  [reported by Randy Terbush]

  *) Imagemap module is enabled in default Configuration

  *) RefererLog and UserAgentLog modules properly default the logfile
     [Randy Terbush]

  *) Mark Cox's mod_cookies added to the distribution as an optional
     module (commented out in the default Configuration, and noted as
     an experiment, along with mod_dld). [Mark Cox]

  *) Compiles on ULTRIX (a continuing battle...). [Robert Thau]

  *) Fixed nasty bug in SIGTERM handling [reported by Randy Terbush]

  *) Changed "Shambhala" to "Apache" in API docs. [Robert Thau]

  *) Added new, toothier legal disclaimer. [Robert Thau; copied from BSD
     license]

Changes with Apache 0.8.1

  *) New imagemap module [Randy Terbush]

  *) Replacement referer log module with NCSA-compatible RefererIgnore
     [Matthew Gray again]

  *) Don't mung directory listings with very long filenames.
     [Florent Guillaume]

Changes with Apache 0.8.0 (nee Shambhala 0.6.2)                  16 Jul 1995

  *) New config script.  See INSTALL for info.  [Robert Thau]

  *) Scoreboard mechanism for regulating the number of extant server
     processes.  MaxServers and StartServers defaults are the same as
     for NCSA, but the meanings are slightly different.  (Actually,
     I should probably lower the MaxServers default to 10).

     Before asking for a new connection, each server process checks
     the number of other servers which are also waiting for a
     connection.  If there are more than MaxServers, it quietly dies
     off.  Conversely, every second, the root, or caretaker, process
     looks to see how many servers are waiting for a new connection;
     if there are fewer than StartServers, it starts a new one.  This
     does not depend on the number of server processes already extant.
     The accounting is arranged through a "scoreboard" file, named
     /tmp/htstatus.*, on which each process has an independent file
     descriptor (they need to seek without interference).

     The end effect is that MaxServers is the maximum number of
     servers on an *inactive* server machine, but more will be forked
     off to handle unusually heavy loads (or unusually slow clients);
     these will die off when they are no longer needed --- without
     reverting to the overhead of full forking operation.  There is a
     hard maximum of 150 server processes compiled in, largely to
     avoid forking out of control and dragging the machine down.
     (This is arguably too high).

     In my server endurance tests, this mechanism did not appear to
     impose any significant overhead, even after I forced it to put the
     scoreboard file on a normal filesystem (which might have more
     overhead than tmpfs).  [Robert Thau]

  *) Set HTTP_FOO variables for SSI <!--#exec cmd-->s, not just CGI scripts.
     [Cliff Skolnick]

  *) Read .htaccess files even in directory with <Directory> section.
     (Former incompatibility noted on mailing list, now fixed). [Robert
     Thau]

  *) "HEAD /" gives the client a "Bad Request" error message, rather
     than trying to send no body *and* no headers.  [Cliff Skolnick].

  *) Don't produce double error reports for some very obscure cases
     mainly involving auth configuration (the "all modules decline to
     handle" case which is a sure sign of a server bug in most cases,
     but also happens when authentication is badly misconfigured).
     [Robert Thau]

  *) Moved FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT defines into conf.h (that's what
     it's *for*, and this sort of thing really shouldn't be cluttering
     up the Makefile). [Robert Thau]

  *) Incidental code cleanups in http_main.c --- stop dragging
     sa_client around; just declare it where used.  [Robert Thau]

  *) Another acc-related fix.  (It doesn't like const char
     in some places...). [Mark Cox]

Changes with Shambhala 0.6.1                                     13 Jul 1995

  *) Fixed auth_name-related typos in http_core.c [Brian Behlendorf]
     Also, fixed auth typo in http_protocol.c unmasked by this fix.

  *) Compiles clean with acc on SunOS [Paul Sutton]

  *) Reordered modules in modules.c so that Redirect takes priority
     over ScriptAlias, for NCSA bug-compatibility [Rob Hartill] ---
     believe it or not, he has an actual site with a ScriptAlias and
     a Redirect declared for the *exact same directory*.  Even *my*
     compatibility fetish wouldn't motivate me to fix this if the fix
     required any effort, but it doesn't, so what the hey.

  *) Fixed to properly default several server_rec fields for virtual
     servers from the corresponding fields in the main server_rec.
     [Cliff Skolnick --- 'port' was a particular irritant].

  *) No longer kills off nph- child processes before they are
     finished sending output. [Matthew Gray]

Changes with Shambhala 0.6.0                                     10 Jul 1995

  *) Two styles of timeout --- hard and soft.  soft_timeout()s just put
     the connection to the client in an "aborted" state, but otherwise
     allow whatever handlers are running to clean up.  hard_timeout()s
     abort the request in progress completely; anything not tied to some
     resource pool cleanup will leak.  They're still around because I
     haven't yet come up with a more elegant way of handling
     timeouts when talking to something that isn't the client.  The
     default_handler and the dir_handler now use soft timeouts, largely
     so I can test the feature.  [Robert Thau]

  *) TransferLog "| my_postprocessor ..." seems to be there.  Note that
     the case of log handlers dying prematurely is probably handled VERY
     gracelessly at this point, and if the logger stops reading input,
     the server will hang.  (It is known to correctly restart the
     logging process on server restart; this is (should be!) going through
     the same SIGTERM/pause/SIGKILL routine used to ding an errant CGI
     script).  [Robert Thau]

  *) asis files supported (new module).  [Robert Thau]

  *) IdentityCheck code is compiled in, but has not been tested.  (I
     don't know anyone who runs identd). [Robert Thau]

  *) PATH_INFO and PATH_TRANSLATED are not set unless some real PATH_INFO
     came in with the request, for NCSA bug-compatibility. [Robert Thau]

  *) Don't leak the DIR * on HEAD request for a directory. [Robert Thau]

  *) Deleted the block_alarms() stuff from dbm_auth; no longer necessary,
     as timeouts are not in scope. [Robert Thau]

  *) quoted-string args in config files now handled correctly (doesn't drop
     the last character). [Robert Thau; reported by Randy Terbush]

  *) Fixed silly typo in http_main.c which was suddenly fatal in HP-UX.
     How the hell did it ever work? [Robert Thau; reported by Rob Hartill]

  *) mod_core.c --- default_type returns DEFAULT_TYPE (the compile-time
     default default type); the former default default behavior when all
     type-checkers defaulted had been a core dump.  [Paul Sutton]

  *) Copy filenames out of the struct dirent when indexing
     directories.  (On Linux, readdir() returns a pointer to the same
     memory area every time).  Fix is in mod_dir.c.  [Paul Sutton]

Changes with Shambhala 0.5.3 [not released]

  *) Default response handler notes "file not found" in the error log,
     if the file was not found.  [Cliff Skolnick].

  *) Another Cliff bug --- "GET /~user" now properly redirects (the userdir
     code no longer sets up bogus PATH_INFO which fakes out the directory
     handler). [Cliff Skolnick]

Changes with Shambhala 0.5.2                                     06 Jul 1995

  *) Changes to http_main.c --- root server no longer plays silly
     games with SIGCHLD, and so now detects and replaces dying
     children.  Child processes just die on SIGTERM, without taking
     the whole process group with them.  Potential problem --- if any
     child process refuses to die, we hang in restart.
     MaxRequestsPerChild may still not work, but it certainly works
     better than it did before this!  [Robert Thau]

  *) mod_dir.c bug fixes: ReadmeName and HeaderName
     work (or work better, at least); over-long description lines
     properly terminated. [Mark Cox]

  *) http_request.c now calls unescape_url() more places where it
     should [Paul Sutton].

  *) More directory handling bugs (reported by Cox)
     Parent Directory link is now set correctly. [Robert Thau]

Changes with Shambhala 0.5.1                                     04 Jul 1995

  *) Generalized cleanup interface in alloc.c --- any function can be
     registered with alloc.c as a cleanup for a resource pool;
     tracking of files and file descriptors has been reimplemented in
     terms of this interface, so I can give it some sort of a test.
     [Robert Thau]

  *) More changes in alloc.c --- new cleanup_for_exec() function,
     which tracks down and closes all file descriptors which have been
     registered with the alloc.c machinery before the server exec()s a
     child process for CGI or <!--#exec-->.  CGI children now get
     started with exactly three file descriptors open.  Hopefully,
     this cures the problem Rob H. was having with overly persistent
     CGI connections. [Robert Thau]

  *) Mutual exclusion around the accept() in child_main() --- this is
     required on at least SGI, Solaris and Linux, and is #ifdef'ed in
     by default on those systems only (-DFCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT).
     This uses fcntl(F_SETLK,...) on the error log descriptor because
     flock() on that descriptor won't work on systems which have BSD
     flock() semantics, including (I think) Linux 1.3 and Solaris.

     This does work on SunOS (when the server is idle, only one
     process in the pool is waiting on accept()); it *ought* to work
     on the other systems. [Robert Thau]

  *) FreeBSD and BSDI portability tweaks [Chuck Murcko]

  *) sizeof(*sa_client) bugfix from [Rob Hartill]

  *) pstrdup(..., NULL) returns NULL, [Randy Terbush]

  *) block_alarms() to avoid leaking the DBM* in dbm auth (this should
     be unnecessary if I go to the revised timeout-handling scheme).
     [Robert Thau]

  *) For NCSA bug-compatibility, set QUERY_STRING env var (to a null
     string) even if none came in with the request.  [Robert Thau]

  *) CHANGES file added to distribution ;-).

Changes with Shambhala 0.4.5

  *) mod_dld --- early dynamic loading support [rst]
  *) Add wildcard content handlers for XBITHACK; default_hander now
     invoked with that mechanism (as a handler hanging off mod_core) [rst]
  *) XBITHACK supported as a wildcard content-handler, and 
     configurable at run-time (not just at compile time, as in the
     "patchy server" releases) [rst]

Changes with Shambhala 0.4.4                                     30 Jun 1995

  *) Fixed basic thinkos in mod_dbm_auth.c [rst, reported by Mark Cox]
  *) Handle Addtype x/y .z [rst, reported by Cox]

Changes with Shambhala 0.4.3

  *) Fixed very dumb bug in mod_alias; "Alias" and "Redirect" are not
     synonymous [rst, terbush]

Changes with Shambhala 0.4.1                                     28 Jun 1995

  *) First-cut virtual host implementation; some refit in the config
     reading code, and log management, was necessary to support this [rst]
  *) Sub-pool machinery, originally added to avoid excessive storage
     allocation on listings of large directories (which turned out to
     be the problem that the 0.3 storage accounting was added to
     find).  Subrequests and mod_dir changed to use subpools.  [rst]
  *) More memory debugging --- free list consistency checks. [rst]
  *) Added err_headers to request_rec, with support elsewhere [rst]
  *) Other fixes to minor bugs in mod_dir and mod_includes [rst, terbush]

Changes with Shambhala 0.3                                       19 Jun 1995

  *) Switch ONE_PROCESS to a runtime command-line option (-X)
  *) Don't compile in mod_ai_backcompat by default
  *) Switch name of server from Apache to Shambhala in Makefile
  *) Add some accounting routines to track memory usage in the pools,
     for debugging

Changes with Shambhala 0.2

  *) Set DOCUMENT_ROOT CGI variable
  *) Add single-process debugging, as a compile-time option (ONE_PROCESS)
  *) Add critical section protection to handling of cleanup structures 
     in alloc.c [rst]
  *) Significant code reorg within the server core to group related
     functions together [rst]
  *) Correctly handle clients that hang up before sending any request
     [rst]
  *) Replace dying child processes. [rst]

Changes with Shambhala 0.1                                       12 Jun 1995

   Major rewrite of the pre-existing "patchy server" codebase, by
   Robert Thau (rst).  Significant portions of the server code, such
   as configuration-file handling and HTTP authentication support,
   were ripped out and rewritten from scratch.  Code that was not
   completely rewritten was significantly altered.

   Major changes with this release include:

   *) Introduction of the module API; in request handling, the central 
      machinery just dispatches to various modules, which actually do
      most of the work.  Configuration handling is similar --- modules
      declare their own commands, and the central machinery just
      dispatches to them.  

      API features from shambhala/0.1 were substantially unchanged in
      Apache 1.0 and 1.1.  (1.0 API features not yet present in this
      release, such as wildcard handlers and subpools, were added in
      subsequent Shambhala releases, and were also generally rst's
      work). 

   *) This release included the following modules:

      mod_access      (access control --- allow and deny directives),
      mod_alias       (Alias and Redirect commands),
      mod_auth        (straight HTTP authentication, based on flat-files)
      mod_auth_dbm    (same, with dbm files)
      mod_cgi         (CGI scripts and, in this release, ScriptAlias)
      mod_common_log  (CLF access logs; later renamed mod_log_common)
      mod_dir         (directory indexing)
      mod_include     (server-side includes)
      mod_mime        (AddType directives)
      mod_negotiation (content negotiation)
      mod_userdir     (support for users' public_html directories)

      It also included a mod_ai_backcompat, which was a private hack
      for back-compatibility with rst's own AI-lab servers.

      All of these modules were substantially complete, and functional 
      or nearly so (a few, which implemented features not in use at
      Thau's site, required patches of a few lines).

   *) sub-request machinery, to allow modules to determine how other
      modules would assign MIME types to a given file, or optionally
      serve its content (this is heavily used by mod_dir, mod_include
      and mod_negotiation).

   *) Resource pool system for keeping track of memory allocated and
      files opened in service of a particular request.  Much of the
      code in the modules (when they weren't rewrites) was adjusted to 
      replace a pervasive convention of using fixed-size buffers on
      the stack with an equally pervasive convention of using memory
      allocated with palloc().

   *) Reorganization of data structures associated with a given
      request to eliminate use of global variables and the troublesome 
      unmunge_name function (used in NCSA and early Apache releases to 
      attempt to determine the URI which mapped to a given filename
      --- a difficult proposition, given that it is easy to produce
      setups in which multiple URIs map to the same file).

   *) Source files renamed and rearranged

   *) Very simple pre-forking behavior --- parent process forked off a 
      fixed number of children, and then just waited for SIGHUP.

   *) Other more minor changes too numerous to list.

   This release included modified versions of a lot of code from the
   Apache 0.6.4 public release, plus an early pre-forking patch
   codeveloped by Robert Thau and Rob Hartill.

Changes with Apache 0.7.3                                        20 Jun 1995

   *) There were a bunch of changes between Apache 0.6.4 and 0.7.3 that
      were incorporated by Rob Hartill on the main branch while Robert Thau
      worked on the Shambhala rewrite above.  Most were merged into the
      Shambala architecture after Apache 0.8.0.
