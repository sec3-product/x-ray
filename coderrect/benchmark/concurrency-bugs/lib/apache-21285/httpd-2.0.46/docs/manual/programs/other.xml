<title>Other Programs</title>

<summary>
    <p>The following programs are simple support programs included with the
    Apache HTTP Server which do not have their own manual pages. They are not
    installed automatically. You can find them after the configuration process
    in the <code>support/</code> directory.</p>

<section id="log_server_status"><title>log_server_status</title>
    <p>This perl script is designed to be run at a frequent interval by
    something like cron. It connects to the server and downloads the status
    information. It reformats the information to a single line and logs it to
    a file. Adjust the variables at the top of the script to specify the
    location of the resulting logfile.</p>
</section>

<section id="split-logfile"><title>split-logfile</title>
    <p>This perl script will take a combined Web server access log file and
    break its contents into separate files. It assumes that the first field of
    each line is the virtual host identity (put there by "<code>%v</code>"), and
    that the logfiles should be named that + "<code>.log</code>" in the current
    directory.</p>

    <p>The combined log file is read from stdin. Records read will be appended
    to any existing log files.</p>
