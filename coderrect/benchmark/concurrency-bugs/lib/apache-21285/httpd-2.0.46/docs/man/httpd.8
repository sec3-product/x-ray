.SH "SUMMARY"
 
.PP
httpd is the Apache HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server program\&. It is designed to be run as a standalone daemon process\&. When used like this it will create a pool of child processes or threads to handle requests\&.
 
.PP
In general, httpd should not be invoked directly, but rather should be invoked via apachectl on Unix-based systems or as a service on Windows NT, 2000 and XP and as a console application on Windows 9x and ME\&.
 

.SH "OPTIONS"
 
.RS
 
.TP
-d \fIserverroot\fR
Set the initial value for the ServerRoot directive to \fIserverroot\fR\&. This can be overridden by the ServerRoot directive in the configuration file\&. The default is /usr/local/apache2\&.  
.TP
-f \fIconfig\fR
Uses the directives in the file \fIconfig\fR on startup\&. If \fIconfig\fR does not begin with a /, then it is taken to be a path relative to the ServerRoot\&. The default is conf/httpd\&.conf\&.  
.TP
-k start|restart|graceful|stop
Signals httpd to start, restart, or stop\&. See Stopping Apache for more information\&.  
.TP
-C \fIdirective\fR
Process the configuration \fIdirective\fR before reading config files\&.  
.TP
-c \fIdirective\fR
Process the configuration \fIdirective\fR after reading config files\&.  
.TP
-D \fIparameter\fR
Sets a configuration \fIparameter \fRwhich can be used with <IfDefine> sections in the configuration files to conditionally skip or process commands at server startup and restart\&.  
.TP
-e \fIlevel\fR
Sets the LogLevel to \fIlevel\fR during server startup\&. This is useful for temporarily increasing the verbosity of the error messages to find problems during startup\&.  
.TP
-E \fIfile\fR
Send error messages during server startup to \fIfile\fR\&.  
.TP
-R \fIdirectory\fR
When the server is compiled using the SHARED_CORE rule, this specifies the \fIdirectory\fR for the shared object files\&.  
.TP
-h
Output a short summary of available command line options\&.  
.TP
-l
Output a list of modules compiled into the server\&. This will \fBnot\fR list dynamically loaded modules included using the LoadModule directive\&.  
.TP
-L
Output a list of directives together with expected arguments and places where the directive is valid\&.  
.TP
-S
Show the settings as parsed from the config file (currently only shows the virtualhost settings)\&.  
.TP
-t
Run syntax tests for configuration files only\&. The program immediately exits after these syntax parsing with either a return code of 0 (Syntax OK) or return code not equal to 0 (Syntax Error)\&. If -D \fIDUMP\fR_\fIVHOSTS \fRis also set, details of the virtual host configuration will be printed\&.  
.TP
-v
Print the version of httpd, and then exit\&.  
.TP
-V
Print the version and build parameters of httpd, and then exit\&.  
.TP
-X
Run httpd in debug mode\&. Only one worker will be started and the server will not detach from the console\&.  
.RE
 
.PP
The following arguments are available only on the Windows platform:
 
.RS
 
.TP
-k install|config|uninstall
Install Apache as a Windows NT service; change startup options for the Apache service; and uninstall the Apache service\&.  
.TP
-n \fIname\fR
The \fIname\fR of the Apache service to signal\&.  
.TP
-w
Keep the console window open on error so that the error message can be read\&.
