# logresolve.pl
#
# v 1.2 by robh @ imdb.com
# 
# usage: logresolve.pl <infile >outfile
#
# input = Apache/NCSA/.. logfile with IP numbers at start of lines
# output = same logfile with IP addresses resolved to hostnames where
#  name lookups succeeded.
#
# this differs from the C based 'logresolve' in that this script
# spawns a number ($CHILDREN) of subprocesses to resolve addresses
# concurrently and sets a short timeout ($TIMEOUT) for each lookup in
# order to keep things moving quickly.
#
# the parent process handles caching of IP->hostnames using a Perl hash
# it also avoids sending the same IP to multiple child processes to be
# resolved multiple times concurrently.
#
# Depending on the settings of $CHILDREN and $TIMEOUT you should see
# significant reductions in the overall time taken to resolve your
# logfiles. With $CHILDREN=40 and $TIMEOUT=5 I've seen 200,000 - 300,000
# logfile lines processed per hour compared to ~45,000 per hour
# with 'logresolve'.
#
# I haven't yet seen any noticable reduction in the percentage of IPs
# that fail to get resolved. Your mileage will no doubt vary. 5s is long
# enough to wait IMO.
#
# Known to work with FreeBSD 2.2
# Known to have problems with Solaris
#
# 980417 - use 'sockaddr_un' for bind/connect to make the script work
#  with linux. Fix from Luuk de Boer <luuk_de_boer@pi.net>
