The bug is in function 'generate_table' (sql/sql_delete.cc)

The purpose of this function is to delete all entries in a
table when user issue 'delete from <table name>'. This
process is optimized by deleting the original table and
creating a new table.

int generate_table(...) {
  ...
  pthread_mutex_lock(&LOCK_open);
  ...
  // delete the original table
  // create a new table
  ...
  pthread_mutex_unlock(&LOCK_open);
  ...
  mysql_update_log.write(...);
  ...
}

bool MYSQL_LOG::write(...) {
  ...
  pthread_mutex_lock(&LOCK_log);
  ...
  // log event
  ...
  pthread_mutex_unlock(&LOCK_log);
  ...
}

int mysql_insert(...) {
  ...
  table = open_ltable(...);
  ...
  mysql_update_log.write(...);
  ...
}

TABLE *open_table(...)
  ...
  open_table(...);
  ...
}

TABLE *open_table(...) {
  ...
  pthread_mutex_lock(&LOCK_open);
  ...
  pthread_mutex_unlock(&LOCK_open);
  ...
}

The expected behavior is that the table deletion and the
logging should not be interleaved with other events.

However, in some cases, this assumption will be broken. For
example, the first thread is performing 'delete' while the
other therad is performing 'insert'. The first thread grabs
'LOCK_open', delete the entries in the table, releases
'LOCK_open'. At this time, the second thread gets
'LOCK_open', insert an entry into the same table, release
'LOCK_open', gets 'LOCK_log', logs 'insert' event and
release 'LOCK_log'. Then, the first thread gets 'LOCK_log',
log 'delete' event, and release 'LOCK_log'.

Thread 1                     Thread 2

int generate_table(...)      int mysql_insert(...)
{                            {
  lock(&LOCK_open);
  // delete entries
  unlock(&LOCK_open);

                               lock($LOCK_open);
                               // insert entry
                               unlock($LOCK_open);
                               

                               lock(&LOCK_log);
                               log.write(...);
                               unlock(&LOCK_log);

  lock(&LOCK_log);
  log.write(...);
  unlock(&LOCK_log);

}                            }


If this interleaving happens, the table will have one entry
finally. However, in the log file, the 'insert' event will
precede the 'delete' event, causing an inconsistency. This
inconsistency will probably cause problem in database
recovery because mysql relies on logs to recover the
database.
