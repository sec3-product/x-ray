# X-Ray: Solana Programs Static Analysis Tool

## Introduction

The X-Ray Toolchain, developed by [sec3.dev](https://sec3.dev), is an
open-source, cross-platform command-line interface (CLI) tool designed for
static analysis of Solana programs and smart contracts written in Rust. The
tool parses Rust programs, generates an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), converts
the AST to an LLVM Intermediate Representation (LLVM-IR) format, and applies
static analysis over the LLVM-IR to capture potential issues.

One of the primary goals of this project is to provide a general and extensible
platform for Solana smart contracts code parsing and analysis. During the
analysis process, it tracks and monitors relevant instructions and accounts
information, facilitating detailed analysis and verification of smart
contracts.

In this open-source version, we have compiled and provided several built-in
common rules as examples. These rules are ready to use in analyzing your
programs and serve as references for extending your own custom rules. You can
define additional bug/security-related rules to suit your specific needs.

Additionally, we offer [a production version of the
tool](https://www.sec3.dev/x-ray), which includes a more comprehensive set of
rules for scanning and analysis. We invite you to try it out for even deeper
insights and broader coverage.

### Built-in Rules for Solana Smart Contracts

The X-Ray toolchain provides several built-in rules designed to detect common
vulnerabilities and issues in Solana smart contracts. Below is a summary of
these rules, including their descriptions and related references.

| **Rule ID** | **Rule Name**              | **Description**                                                                                  | **Reference**                                                                                                      |

## Installation

### Platform Support

- **x86 and ARM64 platforms (e.g. Linux, Windows, macOS)**: You can run the
  X-Ray container version directly on these platforms. We recommend using the
  container version for a quick and easy start with scanning.
- **x86-based Linux platforms (native or via
  [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/))**: In addition to the
  container version, you can download and run our precompiled binary
  executables.
- **Other platforms**: If youâ€™re using other platforms or wish to customize or
  modify the code, you can build the project from source. Please refer to the
  [Building from Source](docs/developer.md#building-from-source) section for
  detailed instructions.

### Using Prebuilt Container Images

Find the available container images on [GitHub packages
page](https://github.com/sec3-product/x-ray/pkgs/container/x-ray).

You can run a sanity check by running the following command to display the
version:

```sh
docker run --rm ghcr.io/sec3-product/x-ray:latest -version
```

### Using Prebuilt Binaries

Download binaries from the
[releases page](https://github.com/sec3-product/x-ray/releases). Unzip the
tarball and add `/path/to/extracted/bin` to your `PATH`.

After extracting the binaries, perform a quick sanity check to verify the
installation by running the following command to display the version:

```sh
/path/to/extracted/bin/xray -version
```

### Using Local Builds

For developers who wish to build X-Ray from source, please refer to
[Building from Source](docs/developer.md#building-from-source) for detailed
instructions.

## Usage

### Prepare a Target Repository

To scan a target repository, simply clone it and run the container or binary
CLI, providing the path to the project's root directory -- there's no need to
locate the specific source code files.

For example, we will use
[Solana Labs' Helloworld](https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld.git)
repository. First, clone the repository to your local workspace.

```sh
mkdir -p workspace
git clone https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld.git workspace/example-helloworld
```

### Start a scan

```sh
docker run --rm --volume "$(pwd)/workspace:/workspace" \
  ghcr.io/sec3-product/x-ray:latest \
  /workspace/example-helloworld
```

Alternatively you can use the installed native binary:

```sh
/path/to/extracted/bin/xray workspace/example-helloworld
```

### Example Output

X-Ray will report each detected potential issues along with its code snippet.
At the end of the output, X-Ray will provide a summary.
